## 🤖 What is The Agentic Startup?

**The Agentic Startup** is a spec-driven development framework for Claude Code that transforms how you build software.

### The Problem

Development often moves too fast without proper planning:
- Features built without clear requirements
- Architecture decisions made ad-hoc during coding
- Technical debt accumulates from lack of upfront design
- Teams struggle to maintain consistency across implementations

### The Solution: Spec-Driven Development

**The Agentic Startup** enforces a disciplined workflow:

1. **📋 Specify First** - Create comprehensive specifications before writing code
   - **PRD** (Product Requirements) - What to build and why
   - **SDD** (Solution Design) - How to build it technically
   - **PLAN** (Implementation Plan) - Executable tasks and phases

2. **👀 Review & Refine** - Validate specifications with stakeholders
   - Catch issues during planning, not during implementation
   - Iterate on requirements and design cheaply
   - Get alignment before costly development begins

3. **⚡ Implement with Confidence** - Execute validated plans phase-by-phase
   - Clear acceptance criteria at every step
   - Parallel agent coordination for speed
   - Built-in validation gates and quality checks

4. **📚 Document & Learn** - Capture patterns for future reuse
   - Automatically document discovered patterns
   - Build organizational knowledge base
   - Prevent reinventing solutions

### Core Philosophy

**Measure twice, cut once** - Investing time in specifications saves exponentially more time during implementation.

**Documentation as code** - Specs, patterns, and interfaces are first-class artifacts that evolve with your codebase.

**Parallel execution** - Multiple specialists work simultaneously within clear boundaries, maximizing velocity without chaos.

**Quality gates** - Definition of Ready (DOR) and Definition of Done (DOD) ensure standards are maintained throughout.

```

Claude will orchestrate specialist agents to create:
- **PRD** (Product Requirements) - What to build and why
- **SDD** (Solution Design) - How to build it technically
- **PLAN** (Implementation Plan) - Executable tasks and phases

### Execute the Implementation

Once your specification is ready:

```bash
/start:implement 001
```

Claude executes the plan phase-by-phase with:
- Parallel agent coordination
- Continuous validation
- Real-time progress tracking
- User confirmation at phase boundaries

### Analyze Your Codebase

Discover and document patterns in your code:

```bash
/start:analyze security
```

Claude will:
- Launch parallel specialist agents

```

### Auto-Documentation

The `documentation` skill automatically creates files in the correct location when patterns, interfaces, or domain rules are discovered during:
- Specification creation (`/start:specify`)
- Implementation (`/start:implement`)
- Analysis (`/start:analyze`)

### Deduplication

The skill always checks existing documentation before creating new files, preventing duplicates.

---

## 🎨 The Startup Output Style

Included with the plugin, activated via `/start:init`.

### Personality

**The Startup** embodies:
- **The Visionary Leader** - "We'll figure it out" - execute fast, iterate faster
- **The Rally Captain** - Turn challenges into team victories
- **The Orchestrator** - Run parallel execution like a conductor
- **The Pragmatist** - MVP today beats perfect next quarter

### Communication Style

**How The Startup communicates:**
- High energy, high clarity ("Let's deliver this NOW!")
- Execution mentality ("We've got momentum, let's push!")
- Celebrate wins ("That's what I'm talking about!")
- Own failures fast ("That didn't work. Here's the fix.")
- Always forward motion ("Next, we're tackling...")

### Workflow Patterns

**What you get:**
- Parallel-first mindset (launches multiple agents simultaneously)
- TodoWrite obsession (tracks every task religiously)
- "Ask yourself" checkpoints (self-validation at key decision points)
- Investor update summaries (comprehensive status reports)

### When to Use

**Perfect for:**
- Fast-paced development
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Parallel agent coordination
- High-energy execution

**Maybe not for:**
- Simple single-step tasks
- Exploratory conversations
- Learning/tutorial sessions

---

## 🔄 Typical Development Workflow

Here's how to use The Agentic Startup end-to-end:

### 1. **Initial Setup** (Once per project)

```bash
/start:init
```

Configures output style and statusline.

### 2. **Create Specification**

```bash
/start:specify Add real-time notification system with WebSocket support and email fallback
```

**What happens:**
- Creates `docs/specs/001-notification-system/`
- Generates PRD (requirements and use cases)
- Generates SDD (technical architecture and design)
- Generates PLAN (implementation tasks and phases)
- Documents discovered patterns/interfaces

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes (depending on complexity)

### 3. **Review Specification**

Read generated files:
- `docs/specs/001-notification-system/PRD.md`
- `docs/specs/001-notification-system/SDD.md`
- `docs/specs/001-notification-system/PLAN.md`

Provide feedback if needed, Claude will revise.

### 4. **Execute Implementation**

```bash
/start:implement 001
```

**What happens:**
- Loads PLAN.md
- Executes Phase 1 tasks
- Waits for user confirmation
- Executes Phase 2 tasks
- Continues phase-by-phase until complete

**Duration:** Varies by complexity (hours to days)

### 5. **Analyze Patterns** (During or after implementation)

```bash
/start:analyze technical patterns in notification system
```

**What happens:**
- Discovers patterns used in implementation
- Documents in `docs/patterns/`
- Creates cross-references
- Prevents future duplication

### 6. **Refactor** (As needed)

```bash
/start:refactor Simplify the WebSocket connection manager
```

**What happens:**
- Establishes test baseline
- Analyzes code for improvements
- Applies incremental refactorings
- Validates tests after each change

### 7. **Document Learnings**

Patterns and interfaces are automatically documented throughout the process by the `documentation` skill.

---

## 🤖 Autonomous Skills in Action

### Example 1: Documentation Skill

**Scenario:** During implementation, an agent discovers a pattern

```
Agent output: "I implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API calls"
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. Documentation skill recognizes "pattern" trigger
2. Checks `docs/patterns/` for existing retry patterns
3. Not found → Creates `docs/patterns/api-retry-strategy.md`
4. Uses pattern template
5. Reports: "📝 Created docs/patterns/api-retry-strategy.md"

**You didn't have to:** Manually request documentation or specify the path

---

### Example 2: Agent-Delegation Skill

**Scenario:** Complex task needs breakdown

```
User: "Implement user authentication - break this down into activities"
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. Agent-delegation skill recognizes "break this down"
2. Analyzes task complexity
3. Generates output:

```
Task: Implement user authentication

Activities:
1. Analyze security requirements
2. Design database schema
3. Create API endpoints
4. Build login UI

Dependencies: 1 → 2 → (3 & 4 parallel)

Execution: Sequential (1→2), then Parallel (3&4)

Agent Prompts Generated: ✅
```

**You didn't have to:** Manually create FOCUS/EXCLUDE templates or plan execution strategy

### How Components Work Together

**Commands** orchestrate workflows:
- Launch specialist agents
- Use trigger language to activate skills
- Reference rules for process patterns

**Skills** provide autonomous capabilities:
- Activate based on natural language
- No explicit invocation needed
- Progressive disclosure (load details only when needed)

**Rules** define operational patterns:
- Process workflows (e.g., cycle-pattern)
- Referenced by commands
- Lightweight (just principles)

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Security Approach

The plugin assists with **defensive security tasks only**:
- ✅ Security analysis and assessment
- ✅ Vulnerability identification
- ✅ Security pattern documentation
- ✅ Incident response planning

## 🔄 Migrating from 1.x (Bash Script Version)

**The Agentic Startup** was previously distributed via bash script installer (pre-2.0). If you have the old version installed, here's how to migrate:

### Uninstalling 1.x

The old version installed files to your Claude Code configuration directory. To remove it:

**1. Remove installed files:**

```bash
# Remove agents (if installed globally)
rm -rf ~/.claude/agents/the-*.md

# Remove commands (if installed globally)
rm -rf ~/.claude/commands/s-*.md

# Remove local installation (if used --local flag)
rm -rf ./.the-startup

# Remove output style
rm -rf ~/.claude/output-styles/the-startup.md

# Remove hooks (if any were installed)
rm -rf ~/.claude/hooks/the-startup-*
```

**2. Clean up settings.json:**

The old installer may have modified `~/.claude/settings.json`. Check for and remove:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": "...",  // Remove if it references the-startup
    "statuslineComplete": "..."  // Remove if it references the-startup
  },
  "outputStyle": "The Startup"  // Remove or change to your preference
}
```

**3. Verify cleanup:**

```bash
# Check for any remaining files
find ~/.claude -name "*startup*" -o -name "*the-startup*"
```

### Installing 2.0 (Marketplace Version)

After uninstalling the old version:

```bash
# Add The Agentic Startup marketplace
/plugin marketplace add rsmdt/the-startup

# Install the Start plugin
/plugin install start@the-startup
```

### Key Differences

| 1.x (Deprecated) | 2.0 (Current) |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Bash script installer | Claude Code marketplace |
| Manual file placement | Automatic plugin installation |
| Global/local installation | Plugin-based (isolated) |
| Static agents in files | Dynamic skills system |
| `/s:specify` commands | `/start:specify` commands |
| Manual configuration | `/start:init` wizard |

### Breaking Changes

- **Command prefix changed:** `/s:*` → `/start:*`
- **Agent files no longer used:** Replaced by skills system
- **Hooks now managed by plugin system:** Automated via `/start:init`
- **Settings.json modifications automated:** Use `/start:init` instead of manual edits
