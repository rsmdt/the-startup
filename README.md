## ðŸ¤– What is The Agentic Startup?

**The Agentic Startup** is a spec-driven development framework for Claude Code that transforms how you build software. Think of it as having instant access to expert developers, architects, and engineers - all working together in parallel to turn your ideas into shipped code.

We follow **[Spec-Driven Development](https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=Spec+Driven+Development)**, where comprehensive specifications are created before coding begins, ensuring clarity and reducing rework.

**The workflow**:

1. **ðŸ“‹ Specify** - Turn ideas into comprehensive specification documents
2. **âš¡ Implement** - Execute plans phase-by-phase with parallel agent coordination

The framework leverages **Claude Code's plugin system** to provide workflow commands, autonomous skills, specialized agents, and quality templates - all working together like a high-velocity startup team.

## What's New in 2.0

**Native Claude Code Integration** - Distributed as official marketplace plugins with zero manual configuration

**Autonomous Skills System** - Model-invoked skills that activate based on natural language with progressive disclosure

**Specialized Agent Team** - 11 agent roles across 39+ activity-based specializations (optional `team@the-startup` plugin)

**Migrating from 1.x?** See the [complete migration guide](MIGRATION.md) for step-by-step instructions.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Installation

**Requirements**: Claude Code v2.0+ with marketplace support

```bash
# Add The Agentic Startup marketplace
/plugin marketplace add rsmdt/the-startup

# Install the Start plugin (core workflows)
/plugin install start@the-startup

# (Optional) Install the Team plugin (specialized agents)
/plugin install team@the-startup
```

Alternatively, browse and install interactively via `/plugin`

### Initialize Your Environment

Configure output style and statusline (one-time setup):

```bash
/start:init
```

### Your First Workflow

**1. Create a specification:**
```bash
/start:specify Add user authentication with OAuth support
```

Creates `docs/specs/001-user-authentication/` with product-requirements.md, solution-design.md, and implementation-plan.md documents.

**2. Execute the implementation:**
```bash
/start:implement 001
```

Runs phase-by-phase with parallel agents, validation gates, and progress tracking.

## ðŸ“‹ Commands

Quick reference for all workflow commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start:init` | Initialize environment (output style, statusline) |
| `/start:specify` | Create specification documents from brief description |
| `/start:implement` | Execute implementation plan phase-by-phase |
| `/start:analyze` | Discover and document patterns, rules, interfaces |
| `/start:refactor` | Improve code quality while preserving behavior |

## ðŸ”„ Typical Development Workflow

### Specify â†’ Implement

**1. Create Specification**

```bash
/start:specify Add real-time notification system with WebSocket support
```

- Creates comprehensive specs in `docs/specs/001-notification-system/`
- Documents discovered patterns and interfaces
- Duration: 15-30 minutes

**2. Execute Implementation**

```bash
/start:implement 001
```

- Executes phases sequentially with user approval
- Parallel agent coordination within phases
- Continuous test validation
- Duration: Varies by complexity

### Separate Workflows

**Analyze existing code:**
```bash
/start:analyze security patterns in authentication
```

**Refactor code safely:**
```bash
/start:refactor Simplify the WebSocket connection manager
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

### The Problem We Solve

Development often moves too fast without proper planning:
- Features built without clear requirements
- Architecture decisions made ad-hoc during coding
- Technical debt accumulates from lack of upfront design
- Teams struggle to maintain consistency across implementations

### Our Approach: Spec-Driven Development

**The Agentic Startup** enforces a disciplined workflow that balances speed with quality:

**1. Specify First** - Create comprehensive specifications before writing code
- **product-requirements.md** - What to build and why
- **solution-design.md** - How to build it technically
- **implementation-plan.md** - Executable tasks and phases

**2. Review & Refine** - Validate specifications with stakeholders
- Catch issues during planning, not during implementation
- Iterate on requirements and design cheaply
- Get alignment before costly development begins

**3. Implement with Confidence** - Execute validated plans phase-by-phase
- Clear acceptance criteria at every step
- Parallel agent coordination for speed
- Built-in validation gates and quality checks

**4. Document & Learn** - Capture patterns for future reuse
- Automatically document discovered patterns
- Build organizational knowledge base
- Prevent reinventing solutions

### Core Principles

**Measure twice, cut once** - Investing time in specifications saves exponentially more time during implementation.

**Documentation as code** - Specs, patterns, and interfaces are first-class artifacts that evolve with your codebase.

**Parallel execution** - Multiple specialists work simultaneously within clear boundaries, maximizing velocity without chaos.

**Quality gates** - Definition of Ready (DOR) and Definition of Done (DOD) ensure standards are maintained throughout.

**Progressive disclosure** - Skills and agents load details only when needed, optimizing token efficiency while maintaining power.
