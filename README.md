# Multi-Agent Orchestration Research

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes research findings on multi-agent orchestration patterns from leading frameworks and implementations. The key finding is that successful systems use a **stateful orchestrator with stateless worker agents** pattern, where the main agent handles all user interaction and state management while sub-agents perform focused execution tasks.

**Overview**: LangChain provides building blocks for AI applications, while LangGraph focuses on stateful, cyclical agent workflows using graph structures.

**Key Features**:
- Graph-based representation where agents are nodes and connections are edges
- Built-in state management with durable execution
- Integration with LangSmith for observability
- Supports complex, cyclical workflows

**State Management**: 
- "Agents require more than just message buffers; they need structured state storage to persist across steps and failures"
- Provides durable execution for long-running processes

### Anthropic's Multi-Agent Research System

**Overview**: Uses an orchestrator-worker pattern with specialized sub-agents.

**Architecture**:
- Lead agent analyzes queries and develops strategies
- Spawns specialized sub-agents (WebSurfer, FileSurfer, Coder, ComputerTerminal)
- Sub-agents operate in parallel with clear boundaries
- "Each subagent needs an objective, an output format, guidance on the tools and sources to use, and clear task boundaries"

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

The most successful pattern identified across frameworks:

- **Orchestrator (Main Agent)**:
  - Manages overall workflow
  - Handles all user interaction
  - Maintains conversation state
  - Delegates to specialized workers

- **Workers (Sub-Agents)**:
  - Focused, single-purpose execution
  - No direct user interaction
  - Stateless operation
  - Return structured results

### 2. MicroAgent Pattern

Microsoft's approach to agent design:

- "Each microagent's system instructions can be tailored for factors specific to its service"
- Natural language interfaces for coordination
- Each agent associated with a specific service or domain
- Promotes loose coupling and high cohesion

### 3. Sequential vs Concurrent Patterns

**Sequential**: Chains agents in predefined order, each processing output from the previous agent.

**Concurrent**: Runs multiple agents simultaneously on the same task for independent analysis.

## State Management Approaches

### Stateless vs Stateful Agents

**Stateless Agents**:
- Treat every interaction independently
- No memory of past interactions
- Simple to develop and maintain
- Resource efficient

**Stateful Agents**:
- Retain contextual information from past interactions
- Enable personalization and continuity
- More complex architecture
- Higher storage and compute costs

**Key Finding**: "Most 'agents' today are essentially stateless workflows: they have no way to persist interactions beyond what fits into the context window"

- [Stateful vs. Stateless AI Agents](https://www.belsterns.com/post/stateful-vs-stateless-ai-agents-what-s-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter)

### Recommended Architecture: Stateful Orchestrator with Stateless Workers

This pattern combines the benefits of both approaches:
- Orchestrator maintains all state and context
- Workers receive complete context for each task
- Enables parallelization and scaling
- Simplifies testing and debugging

## Best Practices

### 1. Context Engineering

"Context engineering is about doing this automatically in a dynamic system. It takes more nuance and is effectively the #1 job of engineers building AI agents"

- Provide clear task boundaries
- Include relevant context without overwhelming
- Structure information for easy parsing

### 2. Error Handling

"Agents are stateful and errors compound. Minor system failures can be catastrophic for agents"

- Implement durable execution
- Design for resumability
- Clear error propagation

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Design

- Centralize user interaction in orchestrator
- Design clear handoff mechanisms
- Preserve context across interactions

### 4. Task Decomposition

From Anthropic's system:
- Break complex queries into subtasks
- Provide each agent with:
  - Clear objective
  - Expected output format
  - Tool/source guidance
  - Task boundaries

## Recommendations

### Orchestrator Design

1. **Responsibilities**:
   - All user interaction
   - State and context management
   - Task decomposition and delegation
   - Result synthesis and presentation

2. **Implementation**:
   ```json
   {
     "conversation_history": [...],
     "task_progress": {...},
     "intermediate_results": {...},
     "user_preferences": {...}
   }
   ```

### Sub-Agent Design

1. **Characteristics**:
   - Single, well-defined purpose
   - Stateless execution
   - No user interaction capability
   - Clear input/output contracts

2. **Context Package**:
   ```json
   {
     "task": "specific_action_to_perform",
     "context": {
       "relevant_data": {...},
       "constraints": [...],
       "previous_findings": {...}
     },
     "expected_output": {
       "format": "structured_data",
       "required_fields": [...]
     }
   }
   ```

### Execution Flow

1. User → Orchestrator: Request/Feedback
2. Orchestrator → Sub-Agent: Task + Context
3. Sub-Agent → Orchestrator: Results
4. Orchestrator decides:
   - Present to user
   - Chain to another agent
   - Request clarification
   - Synthesize multiple results

## Conclusion

The research strongly supports a clear architectural pattern: **stateful orchestrators managing stateless worker agents**. This approach provides the best balance of capability, maintainability, and scalability. The orchestrator handles all complexity around user interaction and state management, while worker agents remain focused tools for specific execution tasks.
