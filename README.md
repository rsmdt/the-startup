# Multi-Agent Orchestration Research

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes research findings on multi-agent orchestration patterns from leading frameworks and implementations. The key finding is that successful systems use a **stateful orchestrator with stateless worker agents** pattern, where the main agent handles all user interaction and state management while sub-agents perform focused execution tasks.

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

The most successful pattern identified across frameworks:

- **Orchestrator (Main Agent)**:
  - Manages overall workflow
  - Handles all user interaction
  - Maintains conversation state
  - Delegates to specialized workers

- **Workers (Sub-Agents)**:
  - Focused, single-purpose execution
  - No direct user interaction
  - Stateless operation
  - Return structured results

### 2. MicroAgent Pattern

Microsoft's approach to agent design:

- "Each microagent's system instructions can be tailored for factors specific to its service"
- Natural language interfaces for coordination
- Each agent associated with a specific service or domain
- Promotes loose coupling and high cohesion

**Source**: [MicroAgents: Exploring Agentic Architecture](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/microagents-exploring-agentic-architecture-with-microservices/)

### 3. Sequential vs Concurrent Patterns

**Sequential**: Chains agents in predefined order, each processing output from the previous agent.

**Concurrent**: Runs multiple agents simultaneously on the same task for independent analysis.

## State Management Approaches

### Stateless vs Stateful Agents

**Stateless Agents**:
- Treat every interaction independently
- No memory of past interactions
- Simple to develop and maintain
- Resource efficient

**Stateful Agents**:
- Retain contextual information from past interactions
- Enable personalization and continuity
- More complex architecture
- Higher storage and compute costs

**Key Finding**: "Most 'agents' today are essentially stateless workflows: they have no way to persist interactions beyond what fits into the context window"

- [Stateful vs. Stateless AI Agents](https://www.belsterns.com/post/stateful-vs-stateless-ai-agents-what-s-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter)

### Recommended Architecture: Stateful Orchestrator with Stateless Workers

This pattern combines the benefits of both approaches:
- Orchestrator maintains all state and context
- Workers receive complete context for each task
- Enables parallelization and scaling
- Simplifies testing and debugging

## Context Management System

### Overview

The `/develop` command implements a sophisticated context management system that enables stateful orchestration with intelligent agent instance management. This system preserves context across interactions while allowing both fresh analysis and continuation of previous work.

### Architecture

```
.the-startup/
└── [sessionId]/
    ├── main.jsonl          # Main orchestrator context log
    ├── a1b2c3.jsonl       # Agent instance (e.g., first BA call)
    ├── d4e5f6.jsonl       # Agent instance (e.g., architect)
    └── g7h8i9.jsonl       # Agent instance (e.g., second BA call)
```

### Agent Instance Management

The orchestrator intelligently manages agent instances through unique identifiers (agentIds):

#### When to Create New Agent Instance (new agentId)
- Fresh analysis task for a different feature
- Independent investigation of separate components
- Parallel work streams that shouldn't share context
- Starting a new line of inquiry

#### When to Reuse Existing Agent Instance (same agentId)
- Clarifications on previous work
- Refinements based on user feedback
- Consolidation of findings
- Continuation of interrupted work
- Iterative improvements

### JSONL Format

Each context file uses a simple, append-only JSONL format:

```json
{"role": "user", "content": "Create user authentication system"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll orchestrate the development of user authentication..."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Include OAuth support"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll refine the requirements to include OAuth..."}
```

### Implementation Details

#### Orchestrator Responsibilities
1. **Session Management**: Creates session folder at `.the-startup/[sessionId]/`
2. **Context Logging**: Writes all interactions to `main.jsonl`
3. **Agent Tracking**: Maintains mapping of agentIds to their purposes
4. **Instance Decisions**: Determines when to create new vs reuse existing instances

#### Sub-Agent Responsibilities
1. **Context Discovery**: Check for `.the-startup/[sessionId]/[agentId].jsonl`
2. **Context Creation**: Create new file if first invocation
3. **Context Reading**: Load previous interactions if file exists
4. **Context Appending**: Add new interactions to maintain history

### Use Cases

#### 1. Fresh Analysis
```
User: "Analyze requirements for user authentication"
Orchestrator: Creates new BA instance with agentId "a1b2c3"

User: "Also analyze payment processing requirements"
Orchestrator: Creates new BA instance with agentId "x7y8z9"
Result: Two separate context files for independent analyses
```

#### 2. Refinement and Clarification
```
User: "Analyze requirements for user authentication"
Orchestrator: Creates BA instance with agentId "a1b2c3"

User: "Can you add two-factor authentication to those requirements?"
Orchestrator: Reuses BA instance "a1b2c3" with previous context
Result: BA continues from where it left off, refining existing work
```

#### 3. Parallel Architecture Work
```
User: "Design the system architecture"
Orchestrator: 
- Creates Architect instance "m1n2o3" for authentication subsystem
- Creates Architect instance "p4q5r6" for payment subsystem
Result: Parallel architecture design with separate contexts
```

#### 4. Consolidation
```
User: "Combine the authentication and payment architectures"
Orchestrator: Reuses Architect instance "m1n2o3" 
- Architect reads its previous auth work
- Consolidates with payment architecture
Result: Unified architecture building on previous work
```

#### 5. Interrupted Work Recovery
```
Session 1:
User: "Design user authentication"
Orchestrator: Creates Architect "m1n2o3", work partially complete

Session 2 (using resume):
User: "/develop 001-user-auth"
Orchestrator: Recognizes existing work, reuses Architect "m1n2o3"
Result: Architect continues from saved state
```

### Example Workflow

```
1. User requests: "Build a user authentication system"

2. Orchestrator creates:
   .the-startup/abc123/main.jsonl
   
3. Chief analyzes → creates instance "ch1" → .the-startup/abc123/ch1.jsonl

4. BA clarifies requirements → creates "ba1" → .the-startup/abc123/ba1.jsonl

5. User adds: "Include OAuth support"

6. BA refines (same instance) → appends to .the-startup/abc123/ba1.jsonl

7. Architect designs → creates "ar1" → .the-startup/abc123/ar1.jsonl

8. Developer implements → creates "dv1" → .the-startup/abc123/dv1.jsonl

Final structure:
.the-startup/
└── abc123/
    ├── main.jsonl  # Full orchestration log
    ├── ch1.jsonl   # Chief's analysis
    ├── ba1.jsonl   # BA's requirements (initial + refinements)
    ├── ar1.jsonl   # Architect's design
    └── dv1.jsonl   # Developer's implementation
```

### Benefits

1. **State Preservation**: Full context maintained across interactions
2. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple instances work independently without collision
3. **Intelligent Continuation**: Agents resume with their specific context
4. **Clear Audit Trail**: Complete history of decisions and refinements
5. **Flexible Orchestration**: Supports both fresh starts and continuations
6. **Debugging Support**: Each agent's thought process is isolated and traceable

## Best Practices

### 1. Context Engineering

"Context engineering is about doing this automatically in a dynamic system. It takes more nuance and is effectively the #1 job of engineers building AI agents"

- Provide clear task boundaries
- Include relevant context without overwhelming
- Structure information for easy parsing

### 2. Error Handling

"Agents are stateful and errors compound. Minor system failures can be catastrophic for agents"

- Implement durable execution
- Design for resumability
- Clear error propagation

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Design

- Centralize user interaction in orchestrator
- Design clear handoff mechanisms
- Preserve context across interactions

### 4. Task Decomposition

From Anthropic's system:
- Break complex queries into subtasks
- Provide each agent with:
  - Clear objective
  - Expected output format
  - Tool/source guidance
  - Task boundaries

## Recommendations

### Orchestrator Design

1. **Responsibilities**:
   - All user interaction
   - State and context management
   - Task decomposition and delegation
   - Result synthesis and presentation

2. **Implementation**:
   ```json
   {
     "conversation_history": [...],
     "task_progress": {...},
     "intermediate_results": {...},
     "user_preferences": {...}
   }
   ```

### Sub-Agent Design

1. **Characteristics**:
   - Single, well-defined purpose
   - Stateless execution
   - No user interaction capability
   - Clear input/output contracts

2. **Context Package**:
   ```json
   {
     "task": "specific_action_to_perform",
     "context": {
       "relevant_data": {...},
       "constraints": [...],
       "previous_findings": {...}
     },
     "expected_output": {
       "format": "structured_data",
       "required_fields": [...]
     }
   }
   ```

### Execution Flow

1. User → Orchestrator: Request/Feedback
2. Orchestrator → Sub-Agent: Task + Context
3. Sub-Agent → Orchestrator: Results
4. Orchestrator decides:
   - Present to user
   - Chain to another agent
   - Request clarification
   - Synthesize multiple results
