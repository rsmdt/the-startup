## ü§ñ What is The Agentic Startup?

The Agentic Startup brings you instant access to expert developers, architects, and engineers - all working together to turn your ideas into shipped code. It is a system for [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) that gives you a virtual engineering team. Instead of one AI trying to do everything, you get specialized experts who collaborate like a real startup team - pragmatic, fast, and focused on shipping.

We follow [Spec-Driven Development](https://www.perplexity.ai/?q=Spec+Driven+Development), where comprehensive specifications are created before coding begins, ensuring clarity and reducing rework.

Think of it as having a CTO, architects, developers, and DevOps engineers on-demand, each bringing their expertise to your project.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Install (2 minutes)
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsmdt/the-startup/main/install.sh | sh
```

<details>
<summary>See all install options</summary>

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsmdt/the-startup/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -h

# Install agents, hooks, and commands for development tools with an interactive TUI
# 
# Usage:
#   the-startup install [flags]

#### `/s:implement`

Executes Specifications with Precision. Orchestrates phase-by-phase execution of implementation plans with specialist agents and continuous validation:

```bash
# Implement a completed specification (requires PLAN.md)
/s:implement 001

# Use specification ID or full name
/s:implement path/to/custom/plan.md
```

What You Get:
- [x] Phase-by-phase execution that loads one phase at a time to prevent cognitive overload
- [x] Mandatory approval gates requiring confirmation between each phase for control
- [x] Smart parallel execution launching multiple agents simultaneously when tasks allow
- [x] Continuous validation running tests and checks after every task completion
- [x] Real-time progress tracking showing exactly what's happening via TodoWrite

<details>
<summary>View workflow</summary>

Process Flow:
1. Initialize and validate that specification exists with PLAN.md
2. Load context by parsing all phases and counting tasks
3. Execute phases one at a time with approval gates
4. Track progress through TodoWrite and PLAN.md checkboxes
5. Complete with summary and next steps

    F --> END[‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**]
```

</details>

#### `/s:refactor`

Improves Code Quality Without Breaking Anything. Orchestrates safe, incremental refactoring that strictly preserves all existing behavior while improving code maintainability:

```bash
# Refactor specific code or modules
/s:refactor improve the authentication module for better testability

# Refactor for specific goals
/s:refactor reduce complexity in the payment processing logic
```

What You Get:
- [x] Guaranteed behavior preservation by running tests for every change and reverting if anything breaks
- [x] Code smell detection that identifies long methods, duplication, complex conditionals, and architecture issues
- [x] Safe incremental changes through small, verifiable refactorings validated independently
- [x] Pattern documentation in `docs/patterns/` for team learning and knowledge sharing

<details>
<summary>View workflow</summary>

Process Flow:
1. Establish baseline by running all tests to ensure starting from green state
2. Analyze code to identify specific refactoring opportunities and risks
3. Get user approval by presenting findings before making changes
4. Execute incrementally by applying one refactoring at a time with validation
5. Validate continuously with tests after every change, stopping if anything fails

</details>

#### `/s:analyze`

Discovers and Document Your System's Hidden Knowledge. Orchestrates iterative analysis cycles to discover and document business rules, technical patterns, and system interfaces:

```bash
# Analyze specific business domain
/s:analyze business rules for user authentication and validation

# Analyze technical patterns
/s:analyze technical patterns in our microservices architecture

# Focus on specific area
/s:analyze security patterns in our payment processing
```

What You Get:
- [x] Auto-generated documentation creating organized docs in `domain/`, `patterns/`, and `interfaces/` folders
- [x] Iterative discovery cycles where each cycle builds on previous findings with your guidance

### Agents - Your Expert Team

The Agentic Startup uses **activity-based agents** that focus on WHAT they do, not WHO they are. Traditional engineering boundaries (backend/frontend) are artificial constraints that reduce LLM performance. Instead, our agents:

- **Focus on activities** - Agents specialize in `api-design` or `component-architecture`, not arbitrary roles
- **Adapt to your stack** - Automatically detect and apply React/Vue/Angular patterns, REST/GraphQL APIs, PostgreSQL/MongoDB optimizations
- **Execute in parallel** - Multiple specialists work simultaneously on related activities
- **Preserve real expertise** - Keep domain specialization (mobile, security, UX) where it genuinely adds value

Each agent receives only relevant context for their specific expertise, reducing cognitive load and improving accuracy.

<details>
<summary>View all specialized agents</summary>

### Known Limitations

- Commands may occasionally need retry due to Claude Code quirks
- Agents sometimes ignore custom instructions
- Your CLAUDE.md and MCPs may affect behavior
- Best practice: Restart Claude Code between major tasks
