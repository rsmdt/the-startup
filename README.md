# The Startup - Agent System for Development Tools

A specialized AI agent system that brings expert developers, architects, and project managers to your development workflow. Install once, use everywhere across all your projects.

## What This Does

**The Startup** transforms your development workflow by providing:
- **Expert AI Agents** - Each specialized in different aspects of software development
- **Specialized Commands** - Agents work together on complex tasks

Perfect for developers who want structured, expert-level guidance on architecture, implementation, testing, and project management.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsmdt/the-startup/main/install.sh | sh
```

This installs globally to `~/.config/the-startup/` and configures Claude Code to use the agents.

### 2. Start Using Agents

```bash
# Create specifications for new features
/s:specify "Create a user authentication system with JWT tokens"

# Resume working on existing specifications
/s:specify 001

# Implement a completed specification
/s:implement 001-user-auth

# Or work with specific agents directly
/the-architect "Design a microservices architecture for e-commerce"
/the-developer "Implement the user login endpoint with validation"
```

## Training Examples for New Agents

### the-lead-developer Examples

**Code Review Scenario:**
```
Context: AI-generated authentication module
User: "The developer agent just created the auth system"
Assistant: "I'll use the-lead-developer agent to review for security and quality."
Result: Comprehensive code review with specific improvements
```

**Refactoring Scenario:**
```
Context: Legacy codebase with performance issues
User: "This codebase has grown messy with duplicate patterns"
Assistant: "Let me use the-lead-developer agent to identify refactoring opportunities."
Result: Architectural improvements and technical debt reduction
```

### the-ux-designer Examples

**Interface Design Scenario:**
```
Context: New dashboard feature needed
User: "We need an analytics dashboard for administrators"
Assistant: "I'll use the-ux-designer agent to create an intuitive, accessible design."
Result: Complete UI/UX design with accessibility compliance
```

**Accessibility Audit Scenario:**
```
Context: Existing app needs compliance
User: "Our application needs to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
Assistant: "Let me use the-ux-designer agent to audit and improve accessibility."
Result: Comprehensive accessibility improvements and compliance plan
```

### the-compliance-officer Examples

**Data Privacy Scenario:**
```
Context: User data collection system
User: "We're collecting user emails and location data"
Assistant: "I'll use the-compliance-officer agent to ensure GDPR compliance."
Result: Complete privacy framework with consent mechanisms
```

**Industry Regulation Scenario:**
```
Context: Healthcare application development
User: "Building a patient records management system"
Assistant: "Let me use the-compliance-officer agent for HIPAA compliance."
Result: Healthcare-specific compliance framework and audit procedures
```

## Troubleshooting Agent Invocation

### Agent Not Being Used Automatically?

**Problem**: Claude does the work directly instead of using agents
**Solution**: Use explicit invocation patterns:
- "Use the-[agent-name] agent to [task]"
- "I need the-[agent-name] specialist for [scenario]"
- "Let me get the-[agent-name] agent to handle [problem]"

### Wrong Agent Selected?

**Problem**: Claude selects inappropriate agent for the task
**Solution**: Be more specific about the domain:
- For bugs: "Use the-site-reliability-engineer to debug this error"
- For design: "Use the-ux-designer to improve this interface"
- For security: "Use the-security-engineer to assess these risks"

### Agent Missing Context?

**Problem**: Agent doesn't have enough information
**Solution**: Provide context explicitly:
- Reference previous conversations: "Building on the authentication system we discussed"
- Include relevant files: "Looking at the user.js model file"
- Specify constraints: "Working within our React/TypeScript stack"

### Complex Task Not Decomposed?

**Problem**: Single agent trying to handle multi-domain task
**Solution**: Use the-chief first:
- "This seems complex - use the-chief to evaluate and route appropriately"
- "I need multiple specialists for this - start with the-chief"

### Multiple Agents Needed?

**Problem**: Task requires several different specializations
**Solution**: Expect task handoffs:
- Agents will create `<tasks>` blocks assigning work to other agents
- Follow the suggested workflow
- Each agent focuses on their expertise area
