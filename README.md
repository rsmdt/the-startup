## What is The Agentic Startup?

The Agentic Startup brings you instant access to expert developers, architects, and engineers - all working together to turn your ideas into shipped code.

The Agentic Startup is an orchestration system for Claude Code that gives you a virtual engineering team. Instead of one AI trying to do everything, you get specialized experts who collaborate like a real startup team - pragmatic, fast, and focused on shipping.

Think of it as having a CTO, architects, developers, and DevOps engineers on-demand, each bringing their expertise to your project.

### Core Philosophy

**Think twice, ship once.** Proper planning accelerates delivery more than jumping straight into code.

- **Humans decide, AI executes** - Critical decisions stay with you; AI handles implementation details
- **Specialist delegation** - Pull in the right expert for each task
- **Documentation drives clarity** - Specs prevent miscommunication and scope creep
- **Parallel execution** - Multiple experts work simultaneously when possible
- **Review everything** - No AI decision goes unreviewed; you stay in control

When you use The Agentic Startup, Claude Code becomes your **technical co-founder** that gathers context first, consults specialists, generates reviewable documentation, then implements with confidence.

### Research Foundation

**Task specialization consistently outperforms role-based organization for LLM agents:**

- **Performance Impact**: Studies show 2.86% to 21.88% accuracy improvement with specialized agents vs single broad agents ([Multi-Agent Collaboration, 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06322v1))
- **Industry Consensus**: Leading frameworks (CrewAI, Microsoft AutoGen, LangGraph) organize agents by **capability** rather than traditional job titles
- **Domain Specialization**: Effective LLM specialization customizes agents according to specific task contextual data ([Agentic LLM Systems, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04093v1))

## Quick Start

Install and start using The Agentic Startup:

```bash
# Install (interactive)
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsmdt/the-startup/main/install.sh | sh

# Activate The Agentic Startup output style for the full experience
/output-style The Startup

# Plan a feature
/s:specify "Add user authentication"

# Build it 
/s:implement 001-user-auth
```

### Note about available MCP

The Agentic Startup tries to be unbiased about which MCP you may have installed, as this is a fast changing topic. However, we recommend that you have at least [`sequentialthunking`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/sequentialthinking/README.md) installed.

**More installation options**: See the [Installation](#installation) section below.

## Your Expert Team - Activity-Based Specialists

The Agentic Startup uses **activity-based agents** that focus on WHAT they do, not WHO they are. Traditional engineering boundaries (backend/frontend) are artificial constraints that reduce LLM performance. Instead, our agents:

- **Focus on activities** - Agents specialize in `api-design` or `component-architecture`, not arbitrary roles
- **Adapt to your stack** - Automatically detect and apply React/Vue/Angular patterns, REST/GraphQL APIs, PostgreSQL/MongoDB optimizations
- **Execute in parallel** - Multiple specialists work simultaneously on related activities
- **Preserve real expertise** - Keep domain specialization (mobile, security, UX) where it genuinely adds value

Each agent receives only relevant context for their specific expertise, reducing cognitive load and improving accuracy.

### `/s:specify` - Plan Before You Build

Creates comprehensive specifications with built-in quality gates:

```bash
# Start fresh with a new feature idea
/s:specify Build a real-time notification system

# Resume working on a specification
/s:specify 001
```

**Documents Created:**
- `docs/specs/[id]-[short-name]/BRD.md` - Business Requirements Document capturing the "why" and business value
- `docs/specs/[id]-[short-name]/PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document defining user-facing features and acceptance criteria
- `docs/specs/[id]-[short-name]/SDD.md` - Solution Design Document detailing technical architecture and implementation approach

    E --> F[üìÑ **Implementation Planning**<br/>Create *PLAN.md*]

    F --> END[üöÄ Ready for /s:implement S001]
```

</details>

### `/s:implement` - Execute the Plan

Takes an implementation plan (PLAN.md) and executes it phase-by-phase with expert delegation:

```bash
# Implement a completed specification (requires PLAN.md)
/s:implement 001

# Implement from a specific PLAN.md file
/s:implement docs/specs/001-auth/PLAN.md

# Use your own plan document
/s:implement my-custom-plan.md
```

**Requirements:**
- Depends on a PLAN.md document (created by `/s:specify` or your own)
- Plan must include phase markers and task lists for execution
- Can use any properly formatted plan document, not just generated ones

**Key Features:**
- üìã Phase-by-phase execution - One phase at a time to prevent overload
- ‚ö° Parallel task execution - Multiple agents work simultaneously within phases
- üõë Phase boundaries - Mandatory stops between phases for review
- üîç Automatic validation - Tests run after each change

<details>
<summary>#### Workflow</summary>

    C --> |no| F[**Final Validation**<br/>Run full test suite<br/>Verify all requirements]
    F --> END[‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**]
```

</details>

### `/s:refactor` - Improve Code Quality

Analyzes code and performs refactoring based on complexity assessment:

```bash
# Refactor specific code or modules
/s:refactor improve the authentication module for better testability

# Refactor for specific goals
/s:refactor reduce complexity in the payment processing logic
```

**Complexity-Based Behavior:**
- **Simple refactoring** ‚Üí Executes immediately with validation at each step
  - Method extraction, variable renaming, small scope changes
  - Direct execution with continuous test validation
  
- **Complex refactoring** ‚Üí Creates specification for later execution
  - Architectural changes, cross-module refactoring, API redesigns
  - Generates `SDD.md` and `PLAN.md` for review before execution
  - Use `/s:implement` to execute the refactoring plan

**Key Features:**
- üéØ Goal clarification - Ensures refactoring objectives are clear
- üîç Validation-first - Tests must pass before and after changes
- üîÄ Complexity routing - Automatic decision between immediate or planned execution
- üõë Safety checkpoints - User approval at critical decision points

The Agentic Startup: "üöÄ TIME TO SHIP! Launching the security squad in parallel!"
```

The style is included at `assets/claude/output-styles/the-startup.md` and makes every session feel like you're building the next unicorn.

## Real-World Examples

### Building Authentication
```
/s:specify Add user authentication with JWT
```
The Agentic Startup orchestrates:
1. **the-analyst** `requirements-clarification` - Uncovers auth needs (OAuth? 2FA? Password reset?)
2. **the-architect** `system-design` - Designs the auth architecture
3. **the-security-engineer** `authentication-systems` - Specifies security requirements
4. **the-software-engineer** `api-design` - Creates JWT endpoints (adapts to Express/Django/FastAPI)
5. **the-software-engineer** `component-architecture` - Builds login UI (React/Vue/Angular patterns)
6. **the-security-engineer** `vulnerability-assessment` - Validates the implementation

### Debugging Production Issues
```
The API is returning 500 errors on user login
```
The Agentic Startup responds:
1. **the-platform-engineer** `incident-response` - Immediate investigation
2. **the-software-engineer** `api-design` or `database-design` - Fix root cause
3. **the-architect** `code-review` - Verify the fix
4. **the-security-engineer** `vulnerability-assessment` - Security validation if auth-related

### Creating a Dashboard
```
/s:specify Admin dashboard for monitoring system metrics
```
The Agentic Startup orchestrates:
1. **the-designer** `user-research` - Understand admin needs
2. **the-designer** `interaction-design` - Create the interface design
3. **the-platform-engineer** `query-optimization` - Efficient metrics queries
4. **the-architect** `system-design` - Design real-time data flow
5. **the-software-engineer** `component-architecture` - Build UI (React/Vue/Angular)
6. **the-software-engineer** `api-design` - Create metrics API (Express/Django/FastAPI)

## How It Works

1. **You make a request** - Either directly or through commands
2. **The Agentic Startup assesses** - Determines complexity and required expertise
3. **Specialists are called** - The right experts for your specific need
4. **Parallel execution** - Multiple experts work simultaneously when possible
5. **Results are synthesized** - Expert input becomes actionable next steps
6. **You ship faster** - With the confidence of a full team behind you

## Quick Start Examples

```bash
# Fix a bug
"Error: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined in auth.js"

# Build a feature  
/s:specify "Add CSV export functionality to reports"

# Optimize performance
"The dashboard takes 10 seconds to load"

# Review code
"Review my authentication implementation for security issues"

# Get unstuck
"I don't know how to structure this microservices architecture"
```

## Disclaimer

While The Agentic Startup aims to enhance Claude Code with specialized agents and structured workflows, be aware of some limitations:

### Command & Documentation Behavior
- **Slash commands** sometimes are not recognized or executed properly despite correct setup, requiring retry
- **Subagents** sometimes do not follow their custom instructions and instead generate generic prompts, breaking intended behavior
- Your **CLAUDE.md** may affect slash command or subagent behaviour
- Your **Installed MCPs** may affect behaviour and implementation.

### Best Practices
- **Restart** Claude Code between major tasks to free resources
- **Verify** generated code and documentation before committing
