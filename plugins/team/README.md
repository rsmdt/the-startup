## Philosophy

### Specialist Expertise

Each agent is designed with:
- **Deep domain knowledge** - Focused expertise in a specific activity
- **Clear boundaries** - Well-defined scope to prevent overlap
- **Proven patterns** - Built on evidence-based practices
- **Pragmatic approach** - Balance technical excellence with delivery

### Activity-Focused Design

Agents are organized by **what they do**, not **who they are**:
- Enables precise routing to the right specialist
- Prevents scope creep and role confusion
- Allows parallel execution of independent activities
- Maintains clear accountability for outcomes

### Quality Without Compromise

Agents enforce quality standards:
- Architectural reviews catch design issues early
- Test strategies ensure comprehensive coverage
- Performance profiling prevents optimization guesswork
- Documentation keeps knowledge accessible
