Apply the requirements-elicitation-methodology skill for 5 Whys technique, concrete examples, boundary identification, and stakeholder interview patterns. Validate requirements with feasibility and acceptance tests.

## Deliverables

1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)
2. User stories with acceptance criteria
3. Requirements traceability matrix
4. Stakeholder analysis and RACI matrix
