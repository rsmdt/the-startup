## Question Techniques

| Technique | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Open-ended** | Encourage stories | "Tell me about..." |
| **Follow-up** | Dig deeper | "Can you say more about that?" |
| **Clarification** | Ensure understanding | "When you say X, what do you mean?" |
| **Contrast** | Explore differences | "How does that compare to...?" |
| **Projection** | Uncover desires | "What would ideal look like?" |
| **Silence** | Let them think | [Wait 5-10 seconds after answers] |

## Questions to Avoid

| Avoid | Problem | Better |
|-------|---------|--------|
| "Do you like...?" | Yes/no answer | "How do you feel about...?" |
| "Would you use...?" | Hypothetical behavior does not equal real | "When did you last...?" |
| "Don't you think...?" | Leading | "What do you think about...?" |
| "What features...?" | Solution-focused | "What problems do you face?" |
