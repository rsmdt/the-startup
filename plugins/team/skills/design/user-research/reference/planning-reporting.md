## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seeking data that confirms beliefs | Ask open questions, look for disconfirming evidence |
| **Leading Questions** | Influencing responses | Review questions for bias |
| **Recency Effect** | Overweighting last interview | Synthesize across all participants |
| **Sample Bias** | Wrong participants | Carefully screen, diverse recruitment |
| **Hypothetical Questions** | "Would you...?" | Ask about past behavior instead |
| **Shelf Research** | No action on findings | Include action items, follow up |
