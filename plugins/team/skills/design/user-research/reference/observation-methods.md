# Observation Methods

Protocols for contextual inquiry and think-aloud usability testing.

## Contextual Inquiry

Observe users in their natural environment to understand real workflows.

### Protocol

```
PREPARATION:
- Define focus areas
- Prepare observation guide
- Get necessary permissions
- Test recording equipment

DURING OBSERVATION:
1. Arrive early, set up quietly
2. Start with brief introduction
3. Observe first, ask questions after
4. Note everything (actions, environment, emotions)
5. Use "teach me" framing

OBSERVATION GUIDE:
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What tools are they using?
- What workarounds do they employ?
- What frustrates them?
- What's in their physical environment?
- Who do they interact with?

DEBRIEF:
- Review observations with participant
- Ask clarifying questions
- Confirm interpretations
```

### Observation Notes Template

```
Participant: [ID]     Date: [Date]     Location: [Where]

- [Tool 2]: [How used]

Pain Points:
- [Frustration observed]

Quotes:

```

## Think-Aloud Protocol

Have users verbalize thoughts while performing tasks.

### Setup Script

```
"I'd like you to complete some tasks while telling me what you're
thinking. There are no wrong answers - I'm testing the design,
not you. Please say out loud whatever you're looking at, thinking,
or feeling as you go through."
```

### Prompts During Session

- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "What do you expect to happen?"
- "What are you looking for?"
- "Why did you click there?"
- "How does this compare to what you expected?"

### Facilitator Rules

- Do not help them complete tasks
- Do not confirm if they're right or wrong
- Do not explain how things work
- Do not interrupt their flow too much
