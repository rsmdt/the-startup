# Synthesis Methods

Transform raw research observations into structured insights through affinity mapping and insight generation.

## Affinity Mapping

Group observations to find patterns.

### Process

**1. CAPTURE (Individual)**
- Write one observation per sticky note
- Use participant quotes
- Include source identifier

**2. CLUSTER (Group)**
- Spread all notes on wall/board
- Group by similarity
- Don't pre-define categories
- Move notes until clusters emerge

**3. NAME (Group)**
- Label each cluster
- Labels should describe the theme
- Not too broad, not too specific

**4. PRIORITIZE**
- Which themes appear most frequently?
- Which have highest impact?
- Which are most actionable?

### Example Clusters

```
Trust           Efficiency      Support
Concerns        Pain Points     Needs

"I don't        "Takes too      "Wish I
know if         many clicks"    could ask
it's safe"                      someone"

"Where's        "Have to        "Help docs
my data?"       enter same      are useless"
                info twice"
```

## Insight Generation

Transform observations into actionable insights.

### Insight Formula

```
[User group] needs [need] because [motivation/context],
but currently [pain point], which means [consequence].
```

### Example

First-time users need clear guidance during setup because they're unfamiliar with the product, but currently the onboarding is overwhelming with too many options, which means they abandon before experiencing value.

### Validation Checklist

- Based on evidence from multiple participants
- Identifies a real need (not a solution)
- Explains the underlying motivation
- Connects to business impact
- Is actionable
