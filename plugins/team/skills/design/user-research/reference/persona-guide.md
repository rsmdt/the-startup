## Persona Development Process

**1. IDENTIFY VARIABLES**
- What attributes differentiate users?
- Goals, behaviors, pain points, context

**2. ANALYZE PATTERNS**
- Cluster research participants
- Find natural groupings
- Validate with quantitative data if available

**3. CREATE PERSONAS**
- 3-5 personas is typical
- Each represents a distinct segment
- Include primary, secondary, negative persona

**4. VALIDATE**
- Review with stakeholders
- Check against additional research
- Refine based on feedback

**5. ACTIVATE**
- Share widely
- Reference in design discussions
- Update as you learn more

## Persona Types

| Type | Purpose | When to Create |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Primary** | Main design target | Always |
| **Secondary** | Important but not primary focus | When segments differ significantly |
| **Negative** | Who we're NOT designing for | When edge cases distract |
| **Proto-persona** | Hypothesis before research | Early exploration |
