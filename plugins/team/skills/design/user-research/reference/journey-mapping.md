# Journey Mapping

Map user experiences across touchpoints to identify pain points and design opportunities.

## Journey Map Structure

```
JOURNEY MAP: [User Type] - [Scenario]

STAGE      | Awareness | Consider | Purchase | Use | Renew
ACTIONS    | What they do at each stage
THOUGHTS   | What they think at each stage
EMOTIONS   | How they feel (hopeful, confused, anxious...)
TOUCHPOINTS| Channels and interfaces involved
PAIN POINTS| Frustrations encountered
OPPORTUNITIES| Design possibilities identified
```

## Journey Mapping Process

**1. DEFINE SCOPE**
- Which persona?
- Which scenario?
- Start and end points?

**2. GATHER DATA**
- Interview transcripts
- Analytics data
- Support tickets
- Observation notes

**3. MAP THE STAGES**
- What are the major phases?
- What triggers transitions?

**4. FILL IN LAYERS**
- Actions at each stage
- Thoughts and questions
- Emotional state
- Touchpoints

**5. IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES**
- Where are the pain points?
- Where can we improve?
- What's the priority?

**6. VALIDATE AND SHARE**
- Review with stakeholders
- Share findings
- Define action items
