# Interview Techniques

Detailed protocols for conducting user interviews that yield rich, unbiased qualitative data.

## Interview Structure

**1. Opening (5 minutes)**
- Build rapport with neutral topics
- Explain the purpose without biasing
- Confirm recording consent
- Set expectations for the session

**2. Context Gathering (10 minutes)**
- Understand their role and background
- Map their typical day or workflow
- Identify tools and touchpoints they use

**3. Core Exploration (25-35 minutes)**
- Use open-ended questions
- Follow the participant's lead
- Probe deeper on interesting topics
- Ask for specific examples and stories

**4. Closing (5 minutes)**
- Ask if anything was missed
- Request permission for follow-up
- Thank them for their time

## Question Types

**Opening Questions** — Establish context:
- "Walk me through a typical day when you..."
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- "How did you first start...?"

**Probing Questions** — Go deeper:
- "What do you mean by...?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

**Clarifying Questions** — Ensure understanding:
- "So if I understand correctly..."
- "You mentioned X, can you tell me more?"
- "When you say X, do you mean...?"

**Projective Questions** — Surface hidden needs:
- "If you had a magic wand, what would you change?"
- "What would your ideal experience look like?"
- "What would have to be true for you to switch?"

## Common Interview Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Leading questions | Biases responses | Ask neutral, open questions |
| Asking about future behavior | People predict poorly | Ask about past behavior instead |
| Accepting vague answers | Loses detail | Probe for specific examples |
| Talking too much | Reduces user input | Embrace silence, let them think |
| Solving during interview | Shifts to validation mode | Save solutions for later |

## Observing Behavior vs Statements

Users often say one thing but do another. Watch for discrepancies:

- **Workarounds**: Creative solutions reveal unmet needs
- **Hesitation**: Confusion or friction points
- **Skipped steps**: What they consider unnecessary
- **Emotional reactions**: Frustration, delight, confusion
- **Tool switching**: Integration pain points
