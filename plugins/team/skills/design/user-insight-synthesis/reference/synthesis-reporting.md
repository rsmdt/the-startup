# Synthesis and Reporting

Transform raw research data into structured insights and stakeholder-ready reports.

## Affinity Mapping Process

**1. Gather Raw Data**
- Write each observation on a separate note
- Include quotes, behaviors, and pain points
- One insight per note

**2. Cluster Related Notes**
- Group similar observations together
- Don't force categories, let them emerge
- Move notes as patterns become clear

**3. Name the Clusters**
- Create descriptive labels for each group
- Labels should capture the theme
- Higher-level groups may emerge

**4. Identify Patterns**
- What themes appear across multiple participants?
- What surprises challenge assumptions?
- What opportunities become clear?

## Presenting Findings

**Lead with insights, not methodology**
- Start with what you learned, not how you learned it
- Save methodology details for appendix

**Use participant voices**
- Include direct quotes that bring findings to life
- Video clips are more powerful than text

**Connect to business outcomes**
- Tie findings to metrics stakeholders care about
- Quantify impact where possible

**Provide clear recommendations**
- Don't just report problems, suggest solutions
- Prioritize by impact and feasibility

## Best Practices

- Recruit participants who actually face the problem you're solving
- Focus on understanding behavior, not validating your ideas
- Look for patterns across participants, not individual opinions
- Always observe what users do, not just what they say
- Use multiple methods to triangulate findings
- Create lightweight deliverables that teams will actually use
- Involve stakeholders in research to build empathy
- Measure research impact through design decisions influenced
