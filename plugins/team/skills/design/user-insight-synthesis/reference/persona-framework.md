# Persona Framework

Create behavioral personas grounded in research data that drive design decisions.

## Behavioral vs Demographic Personas

**Avoid demographic personas** that describe who users are (age, income, job title). These often become stereotypes that don't predict behavior.

**Create behavioral personas** that describe what users do, why they do it, and what barriers they face. These drive design decisions.

## Persona Components

```
[Persona Name]

BEHAVIORAL ARCHETYPE
One sentence describing their core behavior pattern

GOALS
- Primary goal (what they're ultimately trying to achieve)
- Secondary goals (supporting objectives)
- Emotional goals (how they want to feel)

BEHAVIORS
- Key behavior 1 (observed pattern with frequency)
- Key behavior 2 (observed pattern with context)
- Key behavior 3 (observed pattern with trigger)

PAIN POINTS
- Frustration 1 (specific problem with impact)
- Frustration 2 (specific problem with workaround)
- Frustration 3 (specific problem with frequency)

DECISION FACTORS
- What influences their choices
- What trade-offs they make
- What they prioritize

CONTEXT
- When they engage with the product
- Where they use it
- What else competes for attention

QUOTE
"Verbatim quote from research that captures their perspective"

## Creating Personas from Research

**Step 1: Identify Behavior Patterns**
- Review all interview notes and observations
- Tag recurring behaviors, goals, and pain points
- Look for clusters of similar behavior

**Step 2: Define Behavioral Variables**
- List the key dimensions that differentiate users
- Place participants along each dimension
- Identify clusters that represent archetypes

**Step 3: Build Persona Profiles**
- Write narrative based on research data only
- Include direct quotes from participants
- Validate that persona represents multiple participants

**Step 4: Prioritize Personas**
- Identify primary persona (design for first)
- Secondary personas (accommodate)
- Edge cases (consider but don't optimize for)

## Persona Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Fictional details | Creates false confidence | Use only observed data |
| Photos of real people | Triggers stereotypes | Use illustrations or initials |
| Too many personas | Dilutes focus | Limit to 3-5 maximum |
| Demographic focus | Doesn't predict behavior | Focus on goals and behaviors |
| No pain points | Misses design opportunities | Ground in observed frustrations |
