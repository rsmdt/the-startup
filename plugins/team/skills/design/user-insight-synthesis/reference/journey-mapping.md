# Journey Mapping Methodology

Map user experiences across touchpoints to identify pain points and design opportunities.

## Journey Map Components

```
JOURNEY MAP: [User Goal]

PERSONA: [Which persona this represents]
SCENARIO: [Specific context and trigger]

| Stage | [Stage 1] | [Stage 2] | [Stage 3] | [Stage 4] |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Actions | What user does | ... | ... | ... |
| Touchpoints | Channels/interfaces | ... | ... | ... |
| Thoughts | What they're thinking | ... | ... | ... |
| Emotions | How they feel (scale) | ... | ... | ... |
| Pain Points | Frustrations | ... | ... | ... |
| Opportunities | Design possibilities | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Journey Mapping Process

**1. Define Scope**
- Which persona is this for?
- What goal or scenario are we mapping?
- Where does the journey start and end?
- What level of detail do we need?

**2. Map the Current State**
- List all stages from trigger to completion
- Document what users do at each stage
- Identify all touchpoints (channels, systems, people)
- Note what users think and feel
- Mark pain points and moments of delight

**3. Validate with Data**
- Cross-reference with analytics data
- Validate with additional user interviews
- Check assumptions against support data
- Ensure map represents typical experience

**4. Identify Opportunities**
- Where are the highest-impact pain points?
- Where do users drop off or get stuck?
- What moments could be transformed?
- Where can we exceed expectations?

## Journey Map Types

**Current State Maps** — Document how things work today
- Based on research observations
- Reveals improvement opportunities
- Aligns stakeholders on reality

**Future State Maps** — Envision improved experience
- Based on current state insights
- Shows target experience
- Guides design decisions

**Service Blueprints** — Include backend processes
- Shows frontstage and backstage
- Reveals operational dependencies
- Identifies system requirements

## Emotional Curve Mapping

Track emotional state across the journey using a simple scale:

```
Very Positive  +2  ----*----
Positive       +1  ----*---------*----
Neutral         0  *---------*----
Negative       -1  ----*----
Very Negative  -2  ----*----
                   |Stage1|Stage2|Stage3|Stage4|
```

Key moments to identify:
- **Peak moments**: Highest positive emotion (protect and amplify)
- **Valley moments**: Lowest emotion (priority for improvement)
- **Transition points**: Where emotion shifts (critical touchpoints)
- **Ending moments**: Final impression (strong impact on memory)
