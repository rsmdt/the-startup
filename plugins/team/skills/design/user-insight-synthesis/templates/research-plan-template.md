## Usage Instructions

1. Copy the template above
2. Replace bracketed placeholders with actual content
3. Remove sections that don't apply to your study type
4. Add sections as needed for your specific context
5. Review with stakeholders before recruiting

## Section Guidance

### Research Objective
Be specific about what you need to learn. Vague objectives lead to unfocused research. Tie objectives directly to decisions that need to be made.

### Participant Criteria
Be specific enough to recruit the right people, but not so restrictive that you can't find participants. Include both behavioral and demographic criteria as relevant.

### Research Protocol
Plan your time carefully. Allow buffer for late starts and rich conversations. Practice the protocol with a pilot participant before the real sessions.

### Success Criteria
Define upfront what a successful study looks like. This keeps the research focused and makes it easier to know when you're done.

## Examples

### Example: Discovery Research Plan

```markdown
# Research Plan: First-Time Buyer Journey

## Research Objective

### Business Context
Conversion rate for first-time buyers is 40% lower than returning customers. We need to understand what barriers new buyers face.

### Research Questions
1. What triggers first-time buyers to start their purchase journey?
2. What information do they need before making a purchase decision?
3. Where do they get stuck or abandon the process?

### Design Decisions This Will Inform
- Onboarding flow redesign
- Product page information hierarchy
- Checkout simplification priorities

## Methodology

### Selected Method(s)
Contextual inquiry with diary study follow-up - We need to observe actual behavior in context, then track the extended decision journey.

# Research Plan: Checkout Redesign Validation

## Research Objective

### Business Context
We've redesigned the checkout flow based on previous research. We need to validate the new design reduces abandonment.

### Research Questions
1. Can users complete checkout with the new design?
2. Where do users encounter confusion or friction?
3. How does the new design compare to current satisfaction levels?

### Design Decisions This Will Inform
- Ship/don't ship decision for checkout redesign
- Specific UI refinements needed before launch
- Help content requirements
