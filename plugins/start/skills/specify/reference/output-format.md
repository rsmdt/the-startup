Spec: [NNN]-[name]
Documents: PRD [status] | SDD [status] | PLAN [status]

Readiness: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
Confidence: [N]%

Next Steps:

```

## Decision Logging

When user skips a phase or makes a non-default choice, log it in the spec README.md:

```markdown
## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [date] | PRD skipped | User chose to start directly with SDD |
| [date] | Started from PLAN | Requirements and design already documented elsewhere |
```
