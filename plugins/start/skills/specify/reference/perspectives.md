# Research Perspectives

Perspective definitions and focus area mapping for specification research.

---

## Perspectives

| Perspective | Intent | What to Research |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 📋 **Requirements** | Understand user needs | User stories, stakeholder goals, acceptance criteria, edge cases |
| 🏗️ **Technical** | Evaluate architecture options | Patterns, technology choices, constraints, dependencies |
| 🔐 **Security** | Identify protection needs | Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance |
| ⚡ **Performance** | Define capacity targets | Load expectations, latency targets, scalability requirements |
| 🔌 **Integration** | Map external boundaries | APIs, third-party services, data flows, contracts |

## Perspective-Specific Focus

| Perspective | Agent Focus |
|-------------|-------------|
| 📋 Requirements | Interview stakeholders (user), identify personas, define acceptance criteria |
| 🏗️ Technical | Analyze existing architecture, evaluate options, identify constraints |
| 🔐 Security | Assess auth needs, data sensitivity, compliance requirements |
| ⚡ Performance | Define SLOs, identify bottleneck risks, set capacity targets |
| 🔌 Integration | Map external APIs, document contracts, identify data flows |

## Research Synthesis

After parallel research completes:
1. **Collect** all findings from research agents
2. **Deduplicate** overlapping discoveries
3. **Identify conflicts** requiring user decision
4. **Organize** by document section (PRD, SDD, PLAN)
