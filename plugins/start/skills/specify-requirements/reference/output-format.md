## Multi-Angle Final Validation

Before completing the PRD, validate from multiple perspectives:

### Context Review
Verify:
- Problem statement clarity — is it specific and measurable?
- User persona completeness — do we understand our users?
- Value proposition strength — is it compelling?

### Gap Analysis
Identify:
- Gaps in user journeys
- Missing edge cases
- Unclear acceptance criteria
- Contradictions between sections

### User Input
Based on gaps found:
- Formulate specific questions using AskUserQuestion
- Probe alternative scenarios
- Validate priority trade-offs
- Confirm success criteria

### Coherence Validation
Confirm:
- Requirements completeness
- Feasibility assessment
- Alignment with stated goals
- Edge case coverage
