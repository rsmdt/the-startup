# Example: Parallel Research Delegation

This example shows how to decompose a research task into parallel specialist activities.

## Scenario

**User Request:** "Research competitive landscape for our B2B SaaS pricing strategy"

## Task Decomposition

```
Original Task: Research competitive landscape for B2B SaaS pricing

Activities Identified:
1. Analyze Competitor A (Salesforce) pricing
   - Expertise: Market research
   - Output: Pricing analysis document
   - Dependencies: None

2. Analyze Competitor B (HubSpot) pricing
   - Expertise: Market research
   - Output: Pricing analysis document
   - Dependencies: None

3. Analyze Competitor C (Zendesk) pricing
   - Expertise: Market research
   - Output: Pricing analysis document
   - Dependencies: None

4. Synthesize competitive findings
   - Expertise: Strategic analysis
   - Output: Unified competitive strategy
   - Dependencies: Activities 1, 2, 3

Execution Strategy: Mixed
- Parallel: Activities 1-3 (independent research)
- Sequential: Activity 4 (requires all results)

Reasoning: Each competitor analysis is independent. Synthesis must wait for all analyses to complete.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Launch Parallel Research (Agents 1-3)

```
üöÄ Launching 3 parallel research agents

Agent 1: Salesforce Analysis ‚Üí RUNNING
Agent 2: HubSpot Analysis ‚Üí RUNNING
Agent 3: Zendesk Analysis ‚Üí RUNNING

File Coordination Check:
‚úÖ Agent 1 OUTPUT: research/salesforce-pricing.md
‚úÖ Agent 2 OUTPUT: research/hubspot-pricing.md
‚úÖ Agent 3 OUTPUT: zendesk-pricing.md
‚úÖ All paths unique - No collision risk

Parallel Safety Check:
‚úÖ Independent tasks - No dependencies
‚úÖ Read-only research - No shared state
‚úÖ Separate validation - Each can be reviewed independently
‚úÖ Won't block - Different data sources

Status: ‚úÖ SAFE FOR PARALLEL EXECUTION
```

### Phase 2: Await Completion

```
‚è≥ Waiting for parallel agents...

Agent 1: COMPLETE ‚úÖ (45 minutes)
  - Salesforce analysis delivered
  - All sections complete
  - 4 tiers documented

Agent 2: COMPLETE ‚úÖ (52 minutes)
  - HubSpot analysis delivered
  - Freemium model analyzed
  - 3 tiers + free tier documented

Agent 3: COMPLETE ‚úÖ (38 minutes)
  - Zendesk analysis delivered
  - Per-agent model mapped
  - 4 tiers + add-ons documented

All parallel agents complete. Proceeding to synthesis.
```

### Phase 3: Launch Synthesis (Agent 4)

```
üöÄ Launching synthesis agent

Agent 4: Competitive Synthesis ‚Üí RUNNING

Context provided:
- Salesforce results (from Agent 1)
- HubSpot results (from Agent 2)
- Zendesk results (from Agent 3)

Agent 4: COMPLETE ‚úÖ (25 minutes)
  - Cross-competitor patterns identified
  - 5 strategic recommendations generated
  - Positioning opportunities highlighted
```

## Results

### Total Time: 52 minutes (parallel) + 25 minutes (synthesis) = 77 minutes

**Compare to sequential:** 45 + 52 + 38 + 25 = 160 minutes
**Time saved:** 83 minutes (52% faster)

### Deliverables

```
üìÅ research/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ salesforce-pricing.md (Agent 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hubspot-pricing.md (Agent 2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zendesk-pricing.md (Agent 3)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ competitive-strategy.md (Agent 4 synthesis)
```

### Key Insights Generated

From the synthesis agent:

1. **Tiering Pattern:** All three use 3-4 tier structure with similar progression (basic ‚Üí professional ‚Üí enterprise)

2. **Pricing Models:** Mixed approaches
   - Salesforce: Per-user, all-inclusive features
   - HubSpot: Per-contact, freemium base
   - Zendesk: Per-agent, add-on marketplace

3. **Feature Gating:** Core features in all tiers, advanced analytics/automation in top tiers

4. **Freemium:** Only HubSpot uses freemium successfully (strong upgrade triggers identified)

5. **Opportunity:** Gap in mid-market transparent pricing - competitors hide "contact sales" behind top tier

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

‚úÖ **Parallel execution:** Saved 52% time
‚úÖ **Independent research:** No coordination overhead
‚úÖ **Synthesis phase:** Unified findings effectively
‚úÖ **Unique file paths:** No collisions
‚úÖ **Explicit FOCUS/EXCLUDE:** Agents stayed on task

### Improvements for Next Time

- Add time limits to prevent research rabbit holes
- Specify exact format (all agents used slightly different table formats)
- Request specific pricing data points (some agents missed cost-per-user calculations)
- Consider adding validation agent before synthesis (check data accuracy)

## Reusable Template

This pattern works for any parallel research:

```
1. Decompose research into independent topics
2. Create identical FOCUS/EXCLUDE templates
3. Customize context and output paths only
4. Launch all in parallel
5. Synthesis agent consolidates findings
```

**Use when:**
- Researching multiple competitors
- Analyzing multiple technologies
- Gathering multiple data sources
- Interviewing multiple stakeholders
