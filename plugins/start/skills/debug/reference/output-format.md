# Output Format Reference

Guidelines for debug output. See `examples/output-example.md` for concrete conversation examples at each phase.

## Conversational Guidelines

- Use natural, first-person language ("I see you're hitting...", "Found it.")
- Show only relevant code — never walls of text
- Present theories numbered by likelihood
- Always ask before applying fixes
- Report actual test results honestly after applying fixes
