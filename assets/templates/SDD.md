# Solution Design Document

## Constraints

- [Technical, e.g. Language/framework requirements, performance targets]
- [Organizational, e.g. Coding standards, deployment restrictions]
- [Security/Compliance, e.g. Auth requirements, data protection needs]

## Implementation Context

*[INSTRUCTION: List source code files and external documentation needed to understand the existing implementation. This provides the bridge between constraints and solution strategy. Pattern and interface documentation belong in Cross-Cutting Concepts section. The document flows from problem → constraints → existing implementation → solution.]*

### Source Code to Analyze
```yaml
# Core implementation files that must be understood
- file: @src/components/critical/file.ts
  relevance: CRITICAL
  sections: [lines 50-100, function processOrder]
  why: "Core business logic that must be preserved"
  
# Alternative: relative path format
- file: @src/components/critical/file.ts
  relevance: CRITICAL
  sections: [lines 50-100, function processOrder]
  why: "Core business logic that must be preserved"

# Configuration and setup files
- file: @package.json
  relevance: MEDIUM
  why: "Dependencies and scripts that constrain solution"
```

### External Documentation
```yaml
# Third-party library docs and architectural context
- url: https://docs.library.com/api
  relevance: MEDIUM
  why: "API constraints we must work within"

- doc: @docs/architecture/decisions/adr-001.md
  relevance: HIGH
  why: "Previous decisions that constrain approach"
```

### Implementation Boundaries
- **Must Preserve**: [Critical behavior/interfaces to maintain]
- **Can Modify**: [Areas open for refactoring]
- **Must Not Touch**: [Files/systems that are off-limits]

### Project Commands

*[INSTRUCTION: These commands will be discovered during codebase analysis and populated by the create command. This note should not appear in the final PRD.]*

```bash
# Environment Setup
Install Dependencies: [project-specific install command]
Environment Setup: [additional setup steps if needed]
Start Development: [development server command]

# Validation (run after each phase)
Code Quality: [linting/formatting command] 
Type Safety: [type checking command, if applicable]
Run Tests: [test execution command]
Build Project: [build/compile command]

# Database (if applicable)
Database Migration: [migration command]
Database Seed: [test data setup command]

# Additional Project-Specific Commands
[Any other relevant commands discovered in the codebase]
```

*[INSTRUCTION: The execute command should run these validation commands after each implementation phase to ensure code quality and catch issues early. This note should not appear in the final PRD.]*

## Solution Strategy

- [Architecture Pattern, e.g. Describe the approach (e.g., layered, modular, microservice)]
- [Integration Approach, e.g. Describe how this feature integrates with the current system architecture]
- [Justification, e.g. Brief rationale for why this approach fits given the constraints and scope]
- ...

### System-Wide Patterns

- [Performance: Caching strategies, batching approaches, async patterns]
- [i18n/L10n: Multi-language support patterns, localization approaches]
- [Logging/Auditing: Observability patterns, audit trail implementation]

### Implementation Patterns

*[INSTRUCTION: Include code patterns, conventions, and technical approaches that affect multiple parts of the system. This is where recurring implementation details belong when they represent patterns rather than problems.]*

#### Code Patterns and Conventions
[Document recurring code structures, naming conventions, and implementation approaches that ensure consistency]

#### State Management Patterns
[How state, refs, side effects, and data flow are managed across the application]

#### Performance Characteristics
[System-wide performance strategies, optimization patterns, resource management approaches]

#### Integration Patterns
[Common approaches for external service integration, API communication patterns, event handling]

*[INSTRUCTION: For each pattern, provide concrete examples from the codebase. Implementation specifics should follow established patterns in the codebase. The execute command will discover and apply appropriate patterns dynamically. This note should not appear in the final PRD.]*

#### Component Structure Pattern
```pseudocode
# Follow existing component organization in codebase
COMPONENT: FeatureComponent(properties)
  INITIALIZE: local_state, external_data_hooks
  
  HANDLE: loading_states, error_states, success_states
  
  RENDER: 
    IF loading: loading_indicator
    IF error: error_display(error_info)
    IF success: main_content(data, actions)
```

#### Data Processing Pattern
```pseudocode
# Business logic flow
FUNCTION: process_feature_operation(input, context)
  VALIDATE: input_format, permissions, preconditions
  AUTHORIZE: user_access, operation_permissions
  TRANSFORM: input_data -> business_objects
  EXECUTE: core_business_logic
  PERSIST: save_results, update_related_data
  RESPOND: success_result OR error_information
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```pseudocode
# Error management approach
FUNCTION: handle_operation_errors(operation_result)
  CLASSIFY: error_type (validation, business_rule, system)
  LOG: error_details, context_information
  RECOVER: attempt_recovery_if_applicable
  RESPOND: 
    user_facing_message(safe_error_info)
    system_recovery_action(if_needed)
```

#### Test Pattern
```pseudocode
# Testing approach for behavior verification
TEST_SCENARIO: "Feature operates correctly under normal conditions"
  SETUP: valid_input_data, required_system_state
  EXECUTE: feature_operation_with_input
  VERIFY: 
    expected_output_produced
    system_state_updated_correctly
    side_effects_occurred_as_expected
    error_conditions_handled_properly
```

```

**Scenario 3: System Error Recovery**
```gherkin
Given: [Normal operation in progress]
When: [System error occurs during processing]
Then: [Error handled gracefully]
