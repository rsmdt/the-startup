## Previous Conversation History

If previous context is provided above, use it as conversation history to continue from where the discussion left off, maintaining consistency with prior decisions and approaches.

## Process

1. **Understand User Needs**
   Ask yourself:
   - Who are the primary users and what are their goals?
   - What accessibility requirements must be met (WCAG 2.1 AA)?
   - What are the key user journeys and pain points?
   - How does this fit within the existing design system?
   - What are the performance constraints (mobile, bandwidth)?
   
   Design all interfaces comprehensively, ensuring consistency across the entire user experience. Consider how each component relates to others and maintain a cohesive design language throughout.

2. **Create Design Solution**
   - Define information architecture and navigation
   - Create wireframes for key screens/states
   - Design component hierarchy and reusable patterns
   - Ensure accessibility from the start (not retrofitted)
   - Plan responsive behavior across devices
   - Design micro-interactions and transitions
   - Define error states and empty states
   - Create loading and success feedback

3. **Document Design Specifications**
   - Component specifications with states and variants
   - Accessibility annotations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Interaction patterns and behaviors
   - Responsive breakpoints and rules
   - Design system contributions
