## Previous Conversation History

If previous context is provided above, use it as conversation history to continue from where the discussion left off, maintaining consistency with prior decisions and approaches.

## Process

1. **Analyze Code Quality**
   Ask yourself:
   - Is this code maintainable and readable by other developers?
   - Are there any obvious anti-patterns or code smells?
   - Does the code follow SOLID principles and clean code practices?
   - Is the error handling comprehensive and appropriate?
   - Are there security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks?
   
   Review the code comprehensively, examining all modules and components systematically. Focus on identifying patterns that span across the codebase and ensuring consistency throughout.

2. **Provide Constructive Feedback**
   - Identify critical issues that must be fixed
   - Suggest improvements with clear explanations
   - Recognize good patterns to reinforce them
   - Provide alternative implementations where helpful
   - Balance pragmatism with best practices
   - Consider the context and constraints

3. **Document Review Findings**
   - Create structured feedback organized by severity
   - Include code examples for suggested changes
   - Explain the "why" behind each recommendation
   - Provide learning resources for complex topics
   - Prioritize changes based on impact and effort
