## Context Ingestion

*GATE: You MUST fully read all files mentioned in this section before starting any implementation.*

### Specification

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Replace file location with actual path and add/remove files accordingly]
- **PRD**: `docs/specs/[ID]-[feature-name]/PRD.md` - Product Requirements (if exists)
- **SDD**: `docs/specs/[ID]-[feature-name]/SDD.md` - Solution Design

### Key Design Decisions

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Extract critical decisions from the SDD]
- [Critical decision 1]
- [Critical decision 2]

### Implementation Context

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Extract actionable information from specs]
- **Commands to run**: [Project-specific commands from SDD for testing, building, etc.]
- **Patterns to follow**: [Links to relevant pattern docs]
- **Interfaces to implement**: [Links to interface specifications]

## Implementation Phases

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define implementation phases. Each phase is a logical unit of work following TDD principles.]

- [ ] **Phase 1**: [What functionality this phase delivers]
    # [Component/context notes]
    - [ ] **Tests**: [What behavior needs to be tested] `[ref: PRD/SDD section]` `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Implementation**: [What needs to be built to pass tests] `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Implementation**: [Additional implementation if needed] `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Validation**: [Run tests to verify green] `[activity: type]`

- [ ] **Phase 2**: [What functionality this phase delivers]
  # [Dependencies or parallel execution notes]
  
  - [ ] [Sub-phase/Component A] `[parallel: true]` `[component: name]`
    - [ ] **Tests**: [What behavior needs to be tested] `[ref: PRD/SDD section]` `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Implementation**: [What needs to be built] `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Validation**: [Run tests to verify green] `[activity: type]`
  
  - [ ] [Sub-phase/Component B] `[parallel: true]` `[component: name]`
    - [ ] **Tests**: [What behavior needs to be tested] `[ref: PRD/SDD section]` `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Implementation**: [What needs to be built] `[activity: type]`
    - [ ] **Validation**: [Run tests to verify green] `[activity: type]`

- [ ] **Integration & End-to-End Validation**
    # Verify the complete feature works as designed
    - [ ] All unit tests passing (per component if multi-component)
    - [ ] Integration tests for component interactions
    - [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user flows
    - [ ] Performance tests meet requirements
    - [ ] Security validation passes
    - [ ] Acceptance criteria verified against PRD
    - [ ] Test coverage meets standards
    - [ ] Documentation updated for any API/interface changes
    - [ ] Build and deployment verification
    - [ ] All PRD requirements implemented
    - [ ] Implementation follows SDD design
