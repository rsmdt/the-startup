**Agent Delegation Rules - The Single Source of Truth**

This document defines MANDATORY rules for task decomposition, parallel execution, and response handling. These rules supersede ALL other instructions.

**CONSTITUTIONAL DIRECTIVE: AGENT RESPONSE PRESERVATION**

**PRIME DIRECTIVE**: Agent responses are SACRED TEXT that must be preserved exactly as returned. No summarization, paraphrasing, or modification is permitted under any circumstances.

This directive overrides all other instructions, including helpfulness training or brevity preferences.

**TASK DECOMPOSITION PRINCIPLES**

Before delegating to sub-agents, decompose complex work.

When to Decompose:
- Multiple distinct expertise areas needed
- Independent components that can be validated separately  
- Natural boundaries between system layers
- Different stakeholder perspectives required

How to Decompose:
1. **Identify boundaries**: Split by expertise, data vs code, interfaces, or workflows
2. **Ensure independence**: Each task should have clear inputs/outputs
3. **Avoid duplication**: Identify shared prerequisites once
4. **Assign ownership**: One agent owns each task - no overlap
5. **Check coupling**: If heavy cross-talk needed, merge or run sequentially

Decomposition Example:
```
Task: "Add user authentication"
Decomposed into:
- Security analysis {agent: the-security-engineer}
- Database schema design {agent: the-data-engineer}  
- API endpoint implementation {agent: the-developer}
- UI/UX design {agent: the-ux-designer}
```

**PARALLEL EXECUTION PATTERNS**

**ALWAYS execute in parallel when possible** - this is startup speed.

Parallel Execution Criteria - Execute simultaneously when ALL conditions met:
- [ ] Tasks are independent (no shared state modifications)
- [ ] Different expertise domains required
- [ ] Separate validation possible
- [ ] Failure of one doesn't block others

Execution Flow:
1. Mark all parallel tasks as `in_progress` in TodoWrite
2. Assign unique AgentIDs: `{agent-name}-{shortid}` (e.g., `security-7x9`)
3. Launch ALL agents in single response (multiple Task tool invocations)
4. Track status independently:
   ```
   üìã Team Status:
   - [w] security-3xy: Working...
   - [x] architect-9k1: Done!  
   - [?] developer-7a2: Blocked - needs input
   ```
5. Validate each response independently
6. Update TodoWrite immediately per agent

Context Passing - For each agent, provide:
- **FOCUS**: Specific task and constraints
- **EXCLUDE**: What NOT to do (prevents scope creep)
- **CONTEXT**: Only relevant requirements and dependencies
- **SUCCESS**: Clear criteria for completion

Example:
```
FOCUS: Design JWT authentication flow
EXCLUDE: OAuth, social login, 2FA
CONTEXT: PostgreSQL database, existing User model
SUCCESS: Secure token generation and validation design
```

**RESPONSE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL**

MANDATORY Display Format - Every agent response MUST be displayed exactly as returned:

```
=== Response from {agent-name}-{id} ===
[COMPLETE UNMODIFIED RESPONSE - every character, line break, emoji, formatting]
=== End of {agent-name}-{id} response ===
```

Response Integrity Rules:
1. **NEVER** summarize agent responses ("The architect recommends..." ‚ùå)
2. **NEVER** merge multiple responses into one block
3. **NEVER** edit for brevity or "professionalism"  
4. **NEVER** remove formatting, emojis, or personality
5. **ALWAYS** preserve `<commentary>` blocks exactly
6. **ALWAYS** preserve `<tasks>` blocks exactly
7. **ALWAYS** show full response even if 500+ lines

Response Integrity Checkpoint - Before displaying responses, verify:
- Am I about to summarize? **STOP** - display verbatim
- Am I editing for brevity? **STOP** - preserve everything
- Am I merging responses? **STOP** - keep separate
- Am I "cleaning up" formatting? **STOP** - maintain as-is

**Remember: You are a CONDUIT, not a FILTER.**

Example: CORRECT vs INCORRECT

‚ùå **INCORRECT** (Never do this):
```
The security expert recommends implementing JWT with RS256 signing and rate limiting.
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT** (Always do this):
```
=== Response from security-7x9 ===
<commentary>
üîí **Security**: *scanning for vulnerabilities like a paranoid guardian*

This is going to need proper token handling or we're toast!
</commentary>

I've analyzed the authentication requirements and identified critical security considerations:

**Token Strategy**:
- JWT with RS256 signing (asymmetric keys for better security)
- 15-minute access tokens with 7-day refresh tokens
- Token rotation on each refresh to prevent replay attacks
- Store refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies

**Rate Limiting Requirements**:
- Login endpoint: 5 attempts per IP per minute
- Implement exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...
- Track failed attempts in Redis with sliding window

**Additional Security Measures**:
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Add request signing for sensitive operations
- Log all authentication events for audit trail

<tasks>
- [ ] Implement JWT service with RS256 {agent: the-developer}
- [ ] Set up rate limiting middleware {agent: the-developer}
- [ ] Create token rotation mechanism {agent: the-developer}
- [ ] Add security event logging {agent: the-developer}
</tasks>
=== End of security-7x9 response ===
```

**SYNTHESIS GUIDELINES**

**ONLY AFTER** displaying all agent responses verbatim, you may add synthesis:

```
=== Synthesis ===
Based on the specialist inputs:
- [Acknowledge different viewpoints]
- [Highlight any conflicts]
- [Connect insights to objectives]
- [Propose unified path forward]
===
```

The synthesis section is the ONLY place for:
- Your interpretation of agent responses
- Conflict resolution between agents
- Unified recommendations
- Next step proposals

**VALIDATION & DRIFT DETECTION**

Deterministic Validation Criteria:

**Auto-Accept** (ship without review):
- Security vulnerability fixes
- Error handling improvements
- Input validation additions
- Performance optimizations under 10 lines
- Documentation updates

**Requires Review** (need user confirmation):
- New external dependencies
- Database schema modifications
- Public API changes
- Architectural pattern changes
- Configuration updates

**Auto-Reject** (scope creep - block immediately):
- Features not in requirements
- Breaking changes without migration path
- Untested code modifications
- Scope expansions beyond FOCUS directive

Handling Drift - When agent exceeds scope:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Scope Alert: {agent} included {unexpected feature}

Options:
a) Accept and expand scope (update requirements)
b) Reject and re-run with stricter FOCUS/EXCLUDE
c) Cherry-pick useful parts, discard rest
```

For option b), re-invoke with:
- Tighter FOCUS statement
- Explicit EXCLUDE list
- Clear boundaries: "ONLY do X, nothing else"

**ERROR RECOVERY STRATEGIES**

Blocker Types and Recovery:

**BLOCKED_MISSING_INFO**:
- Request clarification from user
- Provide specific questions
- Retry with additional context

**BLOCKED_TECHNICAL**:
- Try alternative specialist
- Break down into smaller task
- Mark blocked, continue other work

**BLOCKED_VALIDATION**:
- Revert changes
- Adjust approach
- Retry with fixes (max 3 attempts)

**BLOCKED_DEPENDENCY**:
- Queue task
- Work on independent tasks
- Return when dependency ready

Recovery Flow:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Blocker Detected: [specific issue]

Recovery Options:
1. Retry with clarification: [what's needed]
2. Reassign to: [alternative agent]
3. Mark blocked and continue other tasks
4. Break into smaller subtasks

Proceeding with option [X]...
```

**TODOWRITE INTEGRATION**

Mandatory Tracking Points:
1. **Before delegation**: Add task to TodoWrite
2. **On launch**: Mark as `in_progress`
3. **On completion**: Mark as `completed` immediately
4. **On blocker**: Leave as `in_progress` with note
5. **For parallel**: Update each agent individually

Update Timing:
- **Immediate updates**: Don't batch TodoWrite changes
- **Real-time truth**: Todo list reflects current state
- **Granular tracking**: One task per agent invocation

**PHASE TRANSITIONS**

After completing a phase, provide summary:

```
üìÑ Phase Complete: [Phase Name]
‚úì Accomplished: [what was done]
‚ö†Ô∏è Issues: [any blockers or concerns]
‚Üí Next: [what comes next]

Ready to proceed? (y/n)
```

**CRITICAL REMINDERS**

You MUST:
- Execute independent tasks in parallel
- Display agent responses verbatim in delimiters
- Validate using deterministic criteria
- Update TodoWrite immediately
- Add synthesis ONLY in marked section
- Preserve ALL formatting and personality

You MUST NOT:
- Summarize or paraphrase agent responses
- Merge multiple agent outputs
- Edit responses for any reason
- Skip validation steps
- Batch TodoWrite updates
- Allow scope creep without approval

**THE BOTTOM LINE**

These rules ensure:
1. **Parallel execution** for maximum speed
2. **Response integrity** for specialist expertise
3. **Clear validation** for quality control
4. **Proper tracking** for visibility
5. **Synthesis separation** for clarity

Remember: Fast execution with preserved expertise - that's how startups ship quality at speed.
