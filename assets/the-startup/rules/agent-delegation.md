Rules for task decomposition and parallel execution.

1. Task Decomposition Principles:

    Decompose complex work by ACTIVITIES (what needs doing), not roles.
    
    ‚úÖ DO: "Build API endpoints", "Create UI components", "Add security layer"  
    ‚ùå DON'T: "Backend engineer do X", "Frontend do Y"

    When to Decompose:
    - Multiple distinct activities needed
    - Independent components that can be validated separately  
    - Natural boundaries between system layers
    - Different stakeholder perspectives required
     
    Example:
    ```
    Task: "Add user authentication"
    ‚Üí Analyze security requirements
    ‚Üí Design database schema  
    ‚Üí Create API endpoints
    ‚Üí Build login/register UI
    ```

    The system automatically matches activities to specialized agents.

2. Parallel Execution Patterns:

    DEFAULT: Always execute in parallel unless tasks depend on each other.

    Parallel Checklist:
    ‚úÖ Independent tasks (no shared state)
    ‚úÖ Different expertise required
    ‚úÖ Separate validation possible
    ‚úÖ Won't block each other

    The FOCUS/EXCLUDE Pattern (Required):
    ```
    FOCUS: [What to do - 2-3 sentences max]
    EXCLUDE: [What NOT to do - prevents scope creep]
    CONTEXT: [Only relevant files/requirements]
    SUCCESS: [Measurable completion criteria]
    ```

    Example:
    ```python
    # Launch simultaneously
    Task(subagent_type="the-backend-engineer", prompt="FOCUS: Build user API...")
    Task(subagent_type="the-software-engineer-database-design", prompt="FOCUS: Design schema...")
    Task(subagent_type="the-security-engineer-authentication-systems", prompt="FOCUS: Review auth...")
    ```

    Result Aggregation:
    - Display each agent response verbatim
    - Synthesize findings after all responses
    - Identify conflicts between results
    - Create unified next steps

3. Validation & Scope Control:

    üü¢ Auto-Accept (ship it):
    - Security vulnerability fixes
    - Error handling improvements
    - Input validation additions
    - Performance optimizations under 10 lines
    - Documentation updates
    
    üü° Requires Review (user confirms):
    - New external dependencies
    - Database schema modifications
    - Public API changes
    - Architectural pattern changes
    - Configuration updates
    
    üî¥ Auto-Reject (scope creep):
    - Features not in requirements
    - Breaking changes without migration
    - Untested code modifications
    - Scope expansions beyond FOCUS directive
    
    When agents drift:
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Scope Alert: Agent added [unexpected feature]
    Options:
    1. Accept and update requirements
    2. Reject and retry with stricter FOCUS
    3. Cherry-pick useful parts
    ```

4. Failure Recovery:

    Fallback Chain:
    ```
    1. Parallel specialists (default)
       ‚Üì if coordination issues
    2. Sequential with context passing
       ‚Üì if specialist fails
    3. Broader domain agent
       ‚Üì if still stuck
    4. DIY (do it yourself)
       ‚Üì if blocked
    5. Escalate to user with options
    ```

    Recovery Tactics:
    - Refine FOCUS/EXCLUDE and retry
    - Break into smaller tasks
    - Try alternative agents
    - Ship partial results with gaps noted

    Key Principle: One agent fails? Others continue. Collect successes before retrying failures.
