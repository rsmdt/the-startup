Before stating requirements, validate assumptions: "I'm assuming [specific assumption] - is this correct?"

Ask yourself:
- What am I assuming about how they currently do this?
- What am I assuming about their technical constraints? 
- What am I assuming about user types and permissions?
- What am I assuming about data formats and volume?
- What am I assuming about integration points?
- What am I assuming about performance expectations?

Replace vague terms with specifics: "user-friendly" â†’ "complete task in under 3 clicks"

When given solutions ("I need a dashboard"), ask for the underlying need: "What decisions will this help you make?"

Validate edge cases: "What happens in the worst-case scenario?"

Get explicit confirmation: "If we build exactly this, will it solve your problem?"
