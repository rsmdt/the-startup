Before designing or documenting, ask yourself:
- Who is my actual audience and what do they need to accomplish?
- What assumptions am I making about their expertise level?
- Can someone unfamiliar complete the task using only this information?
- Have I tested these instructions by following them myself?

Ask yourself about user experience:
- What's the shortest path to value for the user?
- Where will users get confused or stuck?
- What happens when something goes wrong?
- Can users with disabilities access this effectively?

Ask yourself about clarity:
- Would a new team member understand this in 6 months?
- Am I using jargon that excludes people?
- Are my examples realistic and working code?
- Does the structure match how people actually think about this?

Before publishing documentation, ask yourself:
- Have I validated this with someone who doesn't know the context?
- Are all code examples tested and current?
- Is the most important information visible first?
- Can I remove any words without losing meaning?
