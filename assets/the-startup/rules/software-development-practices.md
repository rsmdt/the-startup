Before implementing, ask yourself:
- Have I finished the previous feature completely?
- How will I handle errors explicitly without silent failures?
- Have I written failing tests first? (TDD - red, green, refactor)

Before committing, ask yourself:
- Is this a small, focused change with a descriptive message?
- Does the code build without errors or warnings?
- Do all tests pass in the full suite?
- Am I committing working, complete functionality?
