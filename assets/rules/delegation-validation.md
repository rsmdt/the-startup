# Delegation Validation Protocol

## Post-Response Validation

After EVERY sub-agent response or batch of parallel responses, perform validation:

### Step 1: Drift Detection

Scan response for the following drift indicators:

- **Scope creep**: Features or functionality not in original request
- **Over-engineering**: Unnecessary complexity or abstraction
- **Assumption escalation**: Small assumptions becoming major features
- **Technology sprawl**: Introducing unspecified dependencies or tools
- **Feature bloat**: "Nice to have" or "while we're at it" additions
- **Premature optimization**: Performance improvements not requested
- **Architecture inflation**: More complex patterns than needed

### Step 2: Validation Check

Perform systematic validation:

```
üîç Validating Response from [agent-name]
‚îú‚îÄ Task adherence: [On-track/Drift detected]
‚îú‚îÄ Scope check: [Within bounds/Exceeded]
‚îú‚îÄ Complexity: [Appropriate/Over-engineered]
‚îú‚îÄ Dependencies: [Specified only/New additions]
‚îî‚îÄ Result: [PASS/MINOR DRIFT/MAJOR DRIFT]
```

### Step 3: Handle Validation Results

#### ‚úÖ PASSED (no issues detected)
- Continue with workflow
- No user interruption needed
- Log validation success

#### üìù MINOR DRIFT (reasonable additions)
Additions that might be beneficial but weren't explicitly requested:

```
üìù Minor additions detected:

The agent suggested these additions:
- [Addition 1]: [Brief description]
- [Addition 2]: [Brief description]

These seem reasonable and may improve the solution.
Include them? [Y/n]: _
```

Examples of minor drift:
- Better error handling
- Improved code structure
- Additional validation
- Helpful documentation
- Test coverage suggestions

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR DRIFT (significant deviation)
Substantial changes to scope or approach:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Significant drift detected:

Original scope: [what was requested]
Agent added: [what was added]
Impact: [consequences of the addition]

This represents a significant change to the requirements.

Options:
a) Accept additions (update scope)
b) Reject and revise (strict scope)
c) Partial accept (you specify what to keep)
d) Cancel and reassign task

Your choice [a/b/c/d]: _
```

Examples of major drift:
- New user-facing features
- Additional database tables
- External service integrations
- Authentication systems not requested
- New API endpoints beyond scope

### Step 4: Corrective Actions

If drift is rejected:

1. **Create revised context** with stricter boundaries:
   ```
   PREVIOUS ATTEMPT DRIFT:
   - Agent added [X] which was not requested
   
   STRICT REQUIREMENT:
   - ONLY implement [exactly what's needed]
   - Do NOT add [specific exclusion]
   
   EXCLUDE:
   - [Previous drift item 1]
   - [Previous drift item 2]
   ```

2. **Re-delegate** with clarified context
3. **Document** the drift for future reference

## Validation Rules

### Always Flag for Review:
- New user-facing features not in requirements
- Additional database schema changes
- New external dependencies or services
- Authentication/authorization modifications
- Performance optimizations (unless requested)
- Caching layers (unless requested)
- Additional API endpoints
- New configuration requirements

### Usually Accept Without Interruption:
- Error handling improvements
- Input validation enhancements
- Security best practices
- Code structure improvements
- Documentation additions
- Type safety improvements
- Test suggestions
- Logging additions

### Gray Areas (Use Judgment):
- Refactoring suggestions
- Alternative approaches
- Technology recommendations
- Architecture patterns

## Batch Validation

When multiple agents run in parallel:

1. **Validate each response individually**
2. **Check for conflicts** between responses
3. **Present consolidated validation** if issues found:
   ```
   üîç Batch Validation Results:
   
   the-architect: ‚úÖ PASSED
   the-developer: üìù MINOR DRIFT - Added error handling
   the-data-engineer: ‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR DRIFT - Added caching layer
   
   Address drift issues? [Y/n]: _
   ```
4. **Handle each drift type** appropriately
5. **Ensure consistency** across all responses

## Context Preservation

When re-delegating after validation failure:

```
=== REVISED DELEGATION ===

CONTEXT: [Original context]

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT ISSUE:
The previous response included [specific drift] which is outside scope.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. ONLY implement [specific requirement]
2. Do NOT add [drift item 1]
3. Do NOT include [drift item 2]

EXCLUDE explicitly:
- [All items from previous drift]
- [Any related features to avoid]
```

## Validation Metrics

Track validation patterns for improvement:

- Frequency of drift by agent type
- Common drift patterns
- Success rate after re-delegation
- User acceptance rate of minor drift

## Quick Reference Checklist

For each response, ask:

1. ‚úì Does it solve the requested task?
2. ‚úì Does it stay within boundaries?
3. ‚úì Are all additions justified?
4. ‚úì Is complexity appropriate?
5. ‚úì Are dependencies minimal?
6. ‚úì Would the user be surprised by anything?

If any answer is "no", validation action is required.
