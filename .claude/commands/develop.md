# ðŸš€ Full Development Pipeline

I'll orchestrate a complete development process for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Initial Assessment

First, let me determine if this is a simple request or requires strategic planning:

```bash
# Quick complexity check
if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ ^(fix|update|change|modify|add).*(single|one|simple|small|minor|quick) ]] || [[ $(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | wc -w) -lt 10 ]]; then
    echo "SIMPLE_REQUEST=true"
else
    echo "SIMPLE_REQUEST=false"
fi
```

!if [ "$SIMPLE_REQUEST" = "false" ]; then

## Phase 1: Strategic Assessment

Let me engage our Chief Technology Officer for strategic analysis:

<Task description="Strategic analysis and planning" 
      prompt="Provide strategic analysis for this request: '$ARGUMENTS'. Assess complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex), identify risks and unknowns, and recommend which specialists are needed. Focus on strategic assessment only - no implementation details or timelines."
      subagent_type="the-chief" />

Based on the Chief's assessment, I'll now coordinate the appropriate specialists.

!else

Since this is a straightforward request, I'll proceed directly with implementation.

!fi

## Phase 2: Requirements Clarification

<Task description="Check requirement clarity"
      prompt="Quickly assess if these requirements are clear enough to proceed or need deeper analysis: '$ARGUMENTS'. If vague, we'll need the business analyst. Otherwise, we can proceed. Be concise."
      subagent_type="general-purpose" />

## Phase 3: Specialist Coordination

Now I'll engage the appropriate specialists based on the strategic assessment. I'll:

1. **Display each specialist's commentary exactly as provided** (preserving their personality)
2. **Extract and track all tasks** in a master todo list
3. **Coordinate handoffs** between specialists
4. **Ensure systematic execution** of all identified tasks

### Task Execution Protocol

For each specialist response, I will:
- Print their `<commentary>` block verbatim
- Extract tasks from `<tasks>` blocks
- Update the master todo list
- Execute dependent tasks in proper sequence
- Run parallel tasks simultaneously where indicated

Let me begin the specialist engagement based on the assessments above...

## Implementation Notes

The specific workflow will adapt based on:
- **Simple projects**: Direct to developer â†’ tester
- **Medium projects**: Add architect for design decisions
- **Complex projects**: Full cycle with business analyst â†’ product manager â†’ architect â†’ project manager â†’ developer â†’ tester

Additional specialists (security engineer, data engineer, DevOps, etc.) will be engaged as identified in the strategic assessment.
