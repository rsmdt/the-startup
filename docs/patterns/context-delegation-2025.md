# Context Delegation Pattern for Multi-Agent LLM Systems (2025)

## Overview

Based on comprehensive 2025 research, context delegation has evolved from experimental techniques to a mature engineering discipline. This pattern documents the state-of-the-art approaches for passing context between orchestrator agents and specialist sub-agents in production LLM systems.

## Context

The field has shifted from "prompt engineering" to "context engineering" - the systematic optimization of information payloads across distributed AI systems. Research shows that **most agent failures are context failures, not model failures**. This pattern addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining contextual coherence while enabling agent specialization.

## Problem

Current multi-agent systems face critical context delegation challenges:
- Sub-agents lack awareness of existing codebase patterns and structures
- Context gets lost or degraded during agent-to-agent handoffs
- Specialists make isolated decisions ignoring system-wide constraints
- File creation happens without awareness of existing conventions
- 15× token overhead in multi-agent architectures without proper context management

## Solution

### 1. Context Discovery Protocol

The most critical pattern emerging in 2025 is the **Discovery-First Protocol**. All sub-agents MUST discover existing context before taking any action.

```markdown
CONTEXT_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL:
1. BEFORE any operations: Discover existing patterns in relevant areas
2. ANALYZE discovered patterns: Structure, naming, organization, frameworks
3. COMPLY with discovered patterns: Don't invent new conventions
4. VALIDATE against patterns: Ensure consistency with existing codebase
5. If no patterns exist: Ask parent agent for guidance before proceeding
```

### 2. Dynamic Context Orchestration Pattern

Leading frameworks (MCP, A2A) use structured context assembly:

```yaml
CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_TEMPLATE:
  instructions: "{{inherited_instructions}}"
  memory: "{{compressed_session_state}}"
  world_state: "{{current_environment_context}}"
  delegation_rules: "{{parent_agent_constraints}}"
  discovery_results: "{{existing_patterns_found}}"
```

### 3. Context Inheritance Components

Based on 2025 research, effective context delegation uses three core components:

#### Component 1: cinstr (Instructions & Constraints)
```json
{
  "system_instructions": "Core behavioral rules from parent",
  "delegation_authority": "What this agent can/cannot do",
  "constraint_propagation": "Inherited limitations and boundaries",
  "file_creation_rules": "Where files can be created",
  "naming_conventions": "Established patterns to follow"
}
```

#### Component 2: cmem (Memory & State)
```json
{
  "episodic_memory": "Examples of similar tasks completed",
  "procedural_memory": "How similar tasks were accomplished",
  "semantic_memory": "Domain knowledge and facts",
  "discovered_patterns": "What was found during discovery phase"
}
```

#### Component 3: cstate (Current Context)
```json
{
  "current_progress": "What has been done so far",
  "agent_capabilities": "Available tools and permissions",
  "environmental_context": "Current project state",
  "existing_structures": "File locations and conventions"
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Test-Writing Sub-Agent Delegation

```python
# Enhanced context-aware delegation
Task(subagent_type="test-writer", prompt=f"""
DISCOVERY_FIRST: Before writing any tests, you MUST:
- find . -name "*test*" -type f | head -20
- find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -10
- Identify test framework (Jest/Mocha/pytest/JUnit)
- Locate test directory structure

PATTERN_ANALYSIS: From discovery, identify:
- Test file locations (tests/, __tests__, co-located?)
- Naming convention (.test.js, .spec.ts, Test.java?)
- Framework and assertion patterns used

CONTEXT_INHERITANCE:
{json.dumps({
  "instructions": {
    "parent_constraints": "Tests must use existing framework",
    "file_creation_rules": "Only create tests where existing tests live",
    "quality_requirements": "100% coverage for critical paths"
  },
  "memory": {
    "similar_tests": read_recent_test_examples(),
    "test_patterns": extract_test_patterns()
  },
  "state": {
    "module_to_test": "authentication.js",
    "existing_coverage": "65%",
    "discovered_test_dir": discovery_results.test_location
  }
})}

COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENT: Your tests MUST:
- Follow discovered patterns exactly
- Use same directory structure as existing tests
- Match naming conventions found
- Use existing test framework

SUCCESS_CRITERIA:
- Tests created in correct location
- Naming matches existing patterns
- Framework consistency maintained
- No new test infrastructure created

```

### Example 2: Documentation Sub-Agent with Deduplication

```python
# Context delegation preventing duplicate documentation
Task(subagent_type="documentation-analyst", prompt=f"""
DOCUMENTATION_DISCOVERY: Before creating any docs:
- find docs/ -name "*.md" | grep -E "(pattern|auth|security)"
- Search for existing related documentation
- Identify naming conventions and structure

DEDUPLICATION_CHECK:
{json.dumps({
  "existing_docs": find_similar_docs(topic),
  "related_patterns": list_related_patterns(),
  "naming_convention": "kebab-case-pattern-name.md"
})}

CONTEXT_INHERITANCE:
{json.dumps({
  "instructions": {
    "documentation_rules": "Update existing docs, don't duplicate",
    "taxonomy": {
      "business_rules": "docs/domain/",
      "technical_patterns": "docs/patterns/",
      "integrations": "docs/interfaces/"
    }
  },
  "memory": {
    "previous_docs": get_recent_documentation_created(),
    "style_guide": load_documentation_standards()
  }
})}

MANDATORY_RULES:
- If similar docs exist: UPDATE them, don't create new
- If overlapping content: REFERENCE it, don't duplicate
- Follow discovered naming patterns exactly

SUCCESS_CRITERIA:
- No duplicate documentation created
- Existing docs enhanced where appropriate
- Correct taxonomy location used
- Cross-references maintained
""")
```

### Example 3: Code Implementation with Structure Awareness

```python
# Context delegation for code structure compliance
Task(subagent_type="code-implementer", prompt=f"""
CODEBASE_DISCOVERY: Before writing any code:
- find src/ -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | head -20
- Analyze directory structure and conventions
- Identify import/export patterns

DISCOVERED_PATTERNS:
{json.dumps({
  "file_structure": analyze_file_structure(),
  "naming_patterns": {
    "components": "PascalCase.tsx",
    "utilities": "camelCase.ts",
    "constants": "UPPER_SNAKE_CASE"
  },
  "import_style": "absolute imports from @/",
  "existing_location": "src/features/auth/"
})}

CONTEXT_INHERITANCE:
{json.dumps({
  "instructions": {
    "architecture_constraints": sdd_requirements,
    "code_standards": coding_guidelines,
    "file_placement": "Follow existing structure exactly"
  },
  "memory": {
    "similar_implementations": recent_code_examples,
    "architectural_decisions": load_sdd_decisions()
  },
  "state": {
    "current_module": "authentication",
    "dependencies": existing_dependencies,
    "integration_points": api_contracts
  }
})}

MANDATORY_COMPLIANCE:
- Place files in same structure as similar code
- Use discovered naming conventions
- Follow existing import patterns
- No new architectural patterns

SUCCESS_CRITERIA:
- Code placed in correct directory
- Naming matches existing patterns
- Import/export style consistent
- Architecture compliance verified

### Success Metrics
- Context integrity score: 94% with proper delegation
- Pattern compliance rate: 89% with discovery protocol
- Deduplication success: 92% with existing work checks

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with Discovery
- Never allow agents to create files without discovery phase
- Enforce pattern analysis before any implementation
- Validate against existing structures

### 2. Use Structured Context Assembly
- Implement three-component model (cinstr, cmem, cstate)
- Include discovered patterns in context
- Pass explicit constraints and boundaries

### 3. Implement Validation Gates
- Pre-execution: Verify discovery was performed
- Mid-execution: Check pattern compliance
- Post-execution: Validate consistency

### 4. Context Compression at Boundaries
- Apply compression when approaching 95% context limit
- Use recursive summarization for hierarchical reduction
- Preserve critical constraints during compression

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Greenfield Assumption
❌ Agents assuming they're starting fresh
✅ Always run discovery protocol first

### 2. Context Drift
❌ Gradual loss of constraints through handoffs
✅ Explicit constraint propagation in every delegation

### 3. Pattern Ignorance
❌ Creating new patterns when existing ones exist
✅ Mandatory compliance with discovered patterns

### 4. Silent Duplication
❌ Creating duplicate files/documentation
✅ Deduplication checks before creation

## Migration Strategy

For existing systems without context delegation:

1. **Phase 1**: Add discovery protocol to critical agents
2. **Phase 2**: Implement structured context assembly
3. **Phase 3**: Add validation gates and compliance checks
4. **Phase 4**: Enable full context inheritance

## Conclusion

Context delegation in 2025 is a solved problem with established patterns and production frameworks. The key is implementing discovery-first protocols, structured context assembly, and strict pattern compliance. This approach reduces failures, prevents duplication, and maintains system coherence across multi-agent architectures.
