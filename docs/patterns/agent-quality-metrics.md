# Agent Quality Metrics Pattern

## Executive Summary

This framework ensures the safe transformation of 61 agent files from prescriptive HOW instructions to declarative WHAT objectives. It provides comprehensive validation criteria, test scenarios, quality metrics, and verification processes to guarantee no loss of functionality while achieving measurable improvements in clarity, delegation success, and cognitive load reduction.

## Validation Criteria for Transformed Agents

### Structural Validation

#### 1. Format Compliance
```yaml
validation_rules:
  structure:
    - Must follow 3-Layer Architecture (Identity, Objectives, Boundaries)
    - Total line count must be ≤ 50 lines (excluding frontmatter)
    - Role description must be 1-2 sentences maximum
    - Core objectives limited to 3-5 bullet points
    - Success criteria limited to 2-3 measurable metrics
    
  content_quality:
    - No numbered steps or sequential procedures
    - No tool-specific implementations (npm, git commands)
    - No framework-specific code patterns
    - Boundaries clearly state in/out of scope
    - Explicit delegation targets for out-of-scope items
```

#### 2. Declarative Language Validation
```yaml
language_patterns:
  required:
    - Outcome-focused verbs (ensure, identify, validate, optimize)
    - Measurable results (comprehensive coverage, optimal distribution)
    - Quality standards (industry standards, best practices)
    
  prohibited:
    - Procedural verbs (run, execute, follow, implement steps)
    - Tool commands (npm test, git commit, docker build)
    - Step numbers (Step 1, First do X, Then do Y)
    - Implementation details (use bcrypt, apply @Retryable)
```

### Functional Validation

#### 1. Capability Preservation Matrix
```yaml
capability_tests:
  core_functions:
    test: "Agent handles original use cases"
    method: "Side-by-side comparison with test scenarios"
    pass_criteria: "100% original capabilities maintained"
    
  expertise_coverage:
    test: "Domain knowledge properly represented"
    method: "Expert review against domain requirements"
    pass_criteria: "All critical domain aspects covered"
    
  delegation_clarity:
    test: "Clear handoff points to other agents"
    method: "Trace delegation paths"
    pass_criteria: "No ambiguous or missing delegations"
```

#### 2. Orchestration Compatibility
```yaml
orchestration_tests:
  routing_accuracy:
    test: "the-chief correctly routes to refactored agent"
    method: "Routing simulation with test requests"
    pass_criteria: "≥95% correct routing decisions"
    
  parallel_execution:
    test: "Agent works in parallel workflows"
    method: "Multi-agent scenario testing"
    pass_criteria: "No deadlocks or conflicts"
    
  context_passing:
    test: "Agent receives and uses context properly"
    method: "Context injection testing"
    pass_criteria: "Appropriate context utilization"
```

## Test Scenarios and Test Data

### Scenario Categories

#### 1. Single Agent Scenarios
```yaml

    validation: "Output quality and completeness"
    
  boundary_task:
    description: "Task at edge of agent's scope"
    input: "Request touching multiple domains"
    expected: "Partial solution with clear delegation"
    validation: "Correct scope identification"
    
  ambiguous_task:
    description: "Vague or incomplete requirements"
    input: "High-level request lacking details"
    expected: "Clarification or intelligent defaults"
    validation: "Appropriate handling of ambiguity"
```

#### 2. Multi-Agent Scenarios
```yaml
orchestration_scenarios:
  parallel_independent:
    agents: ["api-design", "database-design", "ui-components"]

    agents: ["requirements-analysis", "architecture-design", "implementation"]
    task: "New feature from concept to code"
    expected: "Proper handoffs with context preservation"
    validation: "Information flow and dependency handling"
    
  error_cascade:
    agents: ["primary-agent", "fallback-agent", "error-handler"]

## Conclusion

This validation framework ensures the safe, measurable, and successful transformation of agents from HOW to WHAT paradigm. By following these validation criteria, test scenarios, and quality metrics, the refactoring process will:

1. **Preserve all existing functionality** while improving clarity
2. **Reduce cognitive load** by 30-50%
3. **Improve delegation success** by 50-66%
4. **Enable better orchestration** with clearer boundaries
5. **Prepare for future platforms** (MCP, multi-agent systems)

The framework provides objective, measurable criteria for success and clear indicators for when intervention is needed, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal risk to system functionality.
