# Agent Transformation Example: Test Strategy

## Current Version (66 lines, HOW-focused)

The current agent has several issues:
- 7 numbered steps in "Approach" section (too prescriptive)
- Multiple framework-specific sections (over-specified)
- Long anti-patterns list (negative focus)
- Verbose framework detection section

## Improved Version (Following Best Practices)

name: the-qa-engineer-test-strategy
description: Creates risk-based testing strategies that catch critical defects before users do while optimizing coverage for maximum impact. Use PROACTIVELY before implementing any feature to establish testing approach.
model: inherit

You are a pragmatic test strategist who prevents failures through calculated risk assessment and intelligent coverage decisions.

## Expertise

Risk-based test prioritization, coverage optimization, and defect prevention through strategic test design. Deep knowledge of testing patterns across unit, integration, and E2E levels.

## Core Responsibilities

- Identify critical user paths and high-risk areas that require thorough testing
- Design optimal test distribution based on risk assessment and ROI analysis  
- Create comprehensive test scenarios covering happy paths, edge cases, and failure modes
- Establish measurable coverage goals aligned with business criticality
- Recommend automation strategies that maximize defect detection while minimizing maintenance

## Key Principles

- Risk drives coverage - test most where failure hurts most
- Behavior over implementation - test what users experience, not how code works
- Prevention over detection - catch issues before they reach production
- Pragmatism over perfection - 80% coverage of critical paths beats 100% coverage of everything

## Deliverables

- **Test Strategy**: Risk matrix, coverage goals, and test distribution plan
- **Test Scenarios**: Comprehensive scenarios with clear expected outcomes
- **Coverage Analysis**: What to test, what to skip, and data-driven rationale
- **Risk Assessment**: Failure modes, impact analysis, and mitigation strategies

Find the bugs that matter before your users do.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Reduced Length
- From 66 lines to ~40 lines (40% reduction)
- Removed verbose framework detection section
- Consolidated anti-patterns into principles

### 2. HOW to WHAT Transformation
- Replaced 7-step approach with 5 responsibility statements
- Removed prescriptive "first do X, then Y" instructions
- Focus on outcomes: "Identify critical paths" not "Map journeys first"

### 3. Following Best Practices
- Clear role definition in opening statement
- Focused expertise section (not sprawling)
- Principles over procedures
- Outcome-oriented responsibilities
- Concise deliverables section

### 4. Applied CLAUDE.md Principles
- Security over performance (risk-based prioritization)
- Tests over development speed (quality focus)
- Readability over cleverness (clear, simple language)
- Explicit over implicit (clear deliverables)

## Transformation Pattern

1. **Consolidate Expertise**: Merge "Focus Areas" and "Core Expertise" into single "Expertise" section
2. **Convert Steps to Outcomes**: Transform numbered approach into responsibility statements
3. **Principles Over Anti-Patterns**: Replace negative "don't do" with positive principles
4. **Remove Over-Specification**: Delete framework-specific details (agent can determine these)
5. **Clarify Deliverables**: Keep "Expected Output" but make it concise

## Applying to All 61 Agents

This pattern can be systematically applied:

### Phase 1: Core System Agents (2 agents)
- `the-chief`: Simplify routing logic, focus on delegation outcomes
- `the-meta-agent`: Clarify agent generation principles

### Phase 2: Engineering Agents (26 agents)
- Software Engineer (10): Focus on deliverables, not implementation steps
- Platform Engineer (11): Emphasize system outcomes over procedures  
- Security Engineer (5): Principles-based security, not checklists

### Phase 3: Specialist Agents (33 agents)
- QA Engineer (4): Testing outcomes, not test procedures
- Architect (7): Design principles, not design steps
- Designer (6): User outcomes, not design process
- ML Engineer (6): Model objectives, not training steps
- Mobile Engineer (5): Platform goals, not development steps
- Analyst (5): Business insights, not analysis procedures

## Validation Criteria

Each transformed agent should:
- ✅ Be under 50 lines (currently averaging 65)
- ✅ Have no numbered procedural steps
- ✅ Focus on responsibilities and outcomes
- ✅ Include clear expertise statement
- ✅ Define deliverables, not processes
- ✅ Use principles over anti-patterns
- ✅ Maintain all original capabilities
