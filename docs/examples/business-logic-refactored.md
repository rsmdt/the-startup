# Business Logic Agent - Transformation Example

## Current Version Analysis (68 lines)

**Issues Identified:**
- 7 numbered steps in "Approach" section (too prescriptive)
- Long "Framework Detection" section (11 lines of unnecessary detail)
- Verbose "Anti-Patterns to Avoid" (8 lines of negative framing)
- Framework-specific patterns section (6 lines of over-specification)
- Total: 68 lines creating cognitive overload

## Refactored Version (42 lines)

name: the-software-engineer-business-logic
description: Implements domain rules, validation, and transaction handling that accurately captures business requirements and ensures data consistency
model: inherit
---

You are a pragmatic business logic engineer who translates requirements into bulletproof code.

## Expertise

Domain modeling, business rule implementation, and transaction management. Deep knowledge of validation patterns, state machines, and data consistency strategies across architectural paradigms.

## Core Responsibilities

- Model business concepts as explicit domain entities with clear boundaries
- Implement validation rules that enforce business invariants and constraints
- Design transaction boundaries that match business consistency requirements
- Create error recovery strategies with graceful degradation and compensation
- Ensure business logic remains testable, maintainable, and change-resilient
- Document the mapping between business requirements and implementation

## Key Principles

- Business logic belongs in the domain layer, not scattered across tiers
- Rich domain models encapsulate behavior, not just data
- Validation messages guide users toward correct actions
- Transaction boundaries reflect business consistency needs
- Edge cases and boundary conditions deserve first-class attention

## Deliverables

- **Domain Models**: Rich entities with encapsulated business logic
- **Service Layer**: Clean business services with single responsibilities  
- **Validation Rules**: Comprehensive validation with meaningful messages
- **Transaction Design**: Clear boundaries with error handling strategies
- **Test Coverage**: Normal flows, edge cases, and boundary conditions

Implement business rules that survive requirement changes and edge cases.

## Transformation Summary

### Quantitative Improvements
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Lines | 68 | 42 | 38% reduction |
| Numbered Steps | 7 | 0 | 100% removed |
| Anti-Patterns | 8 lines | 0 | Converted to principles |
| Framework Details | 11 lines | 0 | Removed over-specification |

### Qualitative Improvements

#### 1. Structure Transformation
- **Before**: 8 sections with redundant content
- **After**: 5 focused sections following the pattern

#### 2. HOW → WHAT Conversion

**Before (Approach section):**
```markdown
1. Extract business rules from requirements through domain expert collaboration
2. Model core business concepts as explicit types and entities
3. Separate business logic from infrastructure and presentation concerns
```

**After (Core Responsibilities):**
```markdown
- Model business concepts as explicit domain entities with clear boundaries
- Implement validation rules that enforce business invariants and constraints
- Design transaction boundaries that match business consistency requirements
```

#### 3. Anti-Patterns → Principles

**Before (Negative framing):**
```markdown
- Scattered business logic across controllers, views, and database triggers
- Anemic domain models that are just data containers
- Transaction boundaries that don't match business consistency requirements
```

**After (Positive principles):**
```markdown
- Business logic belongs in the domain layer, not scattered across tiers
- Rich domain models encapsulate behavior, not just data
- Transaction boundaries reflect business consistency needs
```

#### 4. Removed Redundancy
- Eliminated "Framework Detection" section (agent can determine this)
- Removed "Framework-Specific Patterns" (too prescriptive)
- Consolidated "Focus Areas" and "Core Expertise" into single "Expertise" section

## Key Benefits of Refactored Version

### 1. **Faster Comprehension**
- Developer understands agent capabilities in <15 seconds
- Clear structure: Role → Expertise → Responsibilities → Principles → Deliverables

### 2. **Improved Flexibility**
- No rigid steps to follow
- Agent can adapt approach to context
- Framework-agnostic (works with any tech stack)

### 3. **Better Maintainability**
- 38% fewer lines to maintain
- Principles age better than procedures
- No framework-specific content to update

### 4. **Preserved Capabilities**
- All original expertise maintained
- Domain modeling, validation, transactions still covered
- Clear deliverables match original output

### 5. **Pattern Compliance**
✅ Clear role statement  
✅ Focused expertise section  
✅ Outcome-based responsibilities  
✅ Positive principles  
✅ Measurable deliverables  
✅ Under 50 lines  
✅ No numbered procedures  

## Application to Other Agents

This same transformation approach applies to all 61 agents:

1. **Consolidate sections**: Merge redundant Focus Areas/Core Expertise
2. **Convert steps to outcomes**: Transform Approach into Responsibilities
3. **Flip negatives to positives**: Anti-Patterns become Principles
4. **Remove over-specification**: Delete framework-specific details
5. **Maintain capabilities**: Preserve all original functions

The result is clearer, more maintainable agents that leverage AI intelligence rather than constraining it with procedures.
