# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

### Vision
Enhance Claude Code sub-agent definitions to systematically embed industry best practices in their guidance, transforming them from task-focused specialists into comprehensive mentors that guide toward quality code.

### Problem Statement
Current Claude Code sub-agents in `assets/claude/agents/` provide practical, shipping-focused guidance but lack systematic industry best practices integration. When developers invoke agents like `the-backend-engineer` or `the-qa-engineer`, the guidance lacks TDD workflows, security practices, and architectural principles that prevent technical debt and vulnerabilities.

### Value Proposition
Enhanced sub-agent definitions provide Claude Code users with embedded best practice guidance without requiring additional tools or workflow changes. Agents naturally guide toward quality practices while maintaining their pragmatic effectiveness.

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Claude Code User (Developer)
- **Demographics:** Developers using Claude Code CLI for implementation tasks
- **Goals:** Get comprehensive guidance from specialized agents that includes industry best practices
- **Pain Points:** Current agents focus on shipping but miss systematic quality practices
- **User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want sub-agents to include best practice guidance so that my implementations follow industry standards without additional overhead

### Secondary Personas

#### Team Lead Using Claude Code
- **Demographics:** Senior developers who rely on Claude Code agents for team consistency
- **Goals:** Ensure Claude Code agent guidance aligns with team quality standards
- **Pain Points:** Agent guidance lacks systematic quality practices their team expects
- **User Story:** As a team lead, I want Claude Code agents to reinforce our quality standards so that all team members get consistent guidance

#### Security-Conscious Developer
- **Demographics:** Developers concerned about security in Claude Code-guided implementations
- **Goals:** Ensure Claude Code agents include security best practices in their guidance
- **Pain Points:** Security practices are not systematically included in agent responses
- **User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want Claude Code agents to include security guidance so that implementations are secure by default

## User Journey Maps

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: TDD Workflow Integration for Code-Writing Agents

**Description:** Enhance code-writing sub-agents to include Test-Driven Development workflow guidance in their responses, ensuring Claude Code users receive TDD guidance alongside functional implementation guidance.

**Target Agents:**
- `the-backend-engineer.md`
- `the-frontend-engineer.md` 
- `the-mobile-engineer.md`
- `the-ml-engineer.md`
- `the-data-engineer.md`

**User Flow:**
1. User invokes code-writing agent via `Task(subagent_type="the-backend-engineer")`
2. Agent response includes TDD workflow steps embedded in approach guidance
3. User follows Red-Green-Refactor pattern naturally as part of implementation
4. Agent guides toward proper test boundaries and testing strategies

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: TDD guidance must be embedded in existing agent structure (Focus Areas, Approach sections)
- Rule 2: Maintain tool-agnostic language (mention "testing frameworks" not specific tools)
- Rule 3: Preserve agent personality and pragmatic tone
- Rule 4: TDD integration cannot significantly increase agent definition length

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario: Prototype/proof-of-concept work → Expected: Agent acknowledges TDD value while accepting pragmatic trade-offs
- Scenario: Legacy system modification → Expected: Agent guides incremental test addition approach

### Feature: Security Practice Distribution

**Description:** Systematically distribute domain-specific security practices across security-relevant sub-agents to ensure comprehensive security coverage in Claude Code guidance.

**Target Agents:**
- `the-backend-engineer.md` (API security, input validation)
- `the-frontend-engineer.md` (XSS prevention, client-side security)
- `the-devops-engineer.md` (secrets management, infrastructure security)
- `the-data-engineer.md` (data protection, access controls)
- `the-mobile-engineer.md` (secure storage, platform security)
- `the-security-engineer.md` (comprehensive security practices)
- `the-compliance-officer.md` (regulatory security requirements)

**User Flow:**
1. User invokes security-relevant agent for implementation task
2. Agent response includes domain-specific security practices in guidance
3. User implements with security practices naturally included
4. Security becomes default part of implementation rather than afterthought

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Each security-relevant agent includes exactly 1-2 security practices in guidance
- Rule 2: Security practices must be domain-specific to the agent's expertise
- Rule 3: Security guidance must be actionable and tool-agnostic
- Rule 4: No duplication of generic security advice across agents

### Feature: Requirements Validation and Assumption Prevention

**Description:** Enhance requirements-gathering agents to systematically ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions, preventing the automatic inference of decisions that should be validated with users.

**Target Agents:**
- `the-business-analyst.md` (Requirements clarification, assumption validation)
- `the-product-manager.md` (Stakeholder validation, priority confirmation)
- `the-compliance-officer.md` (Regulation specification, requirement validation)

**User Flow:**
1. User invokes requirements agent with vague or incomplete information
2. Agent identifies potential assumptions and ambiguities in request
3. Agent asks specific clarifying questions before proceeding with analysis
4. Agent validates assumptions explicitly rather than inferring decisions

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Agents must ask at least 3-5 clarifying questions before making recommendations
- Rule 2: Assumptions must be explicitly stated and marked for user validation
- Rule 3: Agents should request concrete examples rather than accepting abstract requirements
- Rule 4: "I'm assuming X, please confirm" pattern must be used for inferences

**Example Enhancement:**
```markdown
## Approach
1. Identify 3-5 critical unknowns before starting analysis
2. Ask "What makes you think that?" for stated assumptions
3. Request concrete examples: "Show me how you do this today"
4. State assumptions explicitly: "I'm assuming X - please confirm"
5. Mark decisions requiring validation: "This needs user confirmation before proceeding"
```

### Feature: Context Drift and Scope Validation

**Description:** Enhance review and quality control agents to systematically check for context drift, scope creep, and alignment with original requirements throughout development processes.

**Target Agents:**
- `the-lead-engineer.md` (Code review scope validation, requirement alignment)
- `the-qa-lead.md` (Testing scope validation, requirement coverage)
- `the-chief.md` (Complexity drift detection, scope boundary enforcement)

**User Flow:**
1. User invokes review agent for quality assessment or complexity evaluation
2. Agent checks current work against original requirements and constraints
3. Agent identifies potential scope drift or context expansion
4. Agent recommends course correction or explicit scope expansion approval

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Review agents must reference original requirements/constraints when available
- Rule 2: Scope changes must be explicitly identified and flagged for approval
- Rule 3: Context drift warnings must be specific and actionable
- Rule 4: Agents should distinguish between natural evolution and problematic drift

**Example Enhancement:**
```markdown
## Approach
1. Cross-reference current scope with original requirements
2. Flag potential scope drift: "This extends beyond original requirements"
3. Validate complexity growth: "Complexity has increased from original assessment"
4. Recommend explicit approval: "This change requires stakeholder confirmation"
5. Maintain focus: "Let's confirm this aligns with core objectives"
```

### Feature: Communication Clarity and Assumption Validation

**Description:** Enhance communication and documentation agents to ask for clarification instead of making assumptions about user intent, stakeholder needs, or design requirements.

**Target Agents:**
- `the-technical-writer.md` (Documentation clarity, assumption validation)
- `the-ux-designer.md` (User need validation, design assumption checking)
- `the-principal-designer.md` (Design vision validation, stakeholder alignment)

**User Flow:**
1. User invokes communication agent with documentation or design task
2. Agent identifies potential ambiguities or unstated assumptions
3. Agent asks specific questions about intent, audience, and success criteria
4. Agent proceeds only after clarifying key assumptions and constraints

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Agents must clarify target audience and success criteria before proceeding
- Rule 2: Design assumptions must be validated with stakeholders
- Rule 3: Documentation scope and depth must be explicitly confirmed
- Rule 4: User research or validation requirements must be identified

**Example Enhancement:**
```markdown
## Approach
1. Clarify target audience: "Who is the primary user of this?"
2. Validate assumptions: "What makes you think users need this?"
3. Confirm scope: "What level of detail is expected?"
4. Check constraints: "Are there any limitations I should know about?"
5. Define success: "How will we know this is effective?"
```

## Integration Requirements

### Claude Code System Integration

| Integration Point | Description | Requirements |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Agent Definition Files** | Enhance markdown files in `assets/claude/agents/` | Maintain YAML frontmatter, preserve structure |
| **Sub-Agent Loading** | Enhanced agents loaded automatically by Claude Code | No changes to loading mechanism required |
| **Task Tool Invocation** | Enhanced agents invoked via existing `Task(subagent_type="name")` pattern | Maintain existing API compatibility |
| **Template System** | Enhancement templates stored in `assets/the-startup/rules/` | Follow existing file pattern for reusable content |

### Enhancement Template System

Enhancement templates will be stored in `assets/the-startup/rules/` following the existing pattern:

```
assets/the-startup/rules/
├── agent-enhancement-templates.md  # Master template patterns
├── tdd-workflow-template.md        # TDD integration patterns  
├── security-practices-template.md  # Security practice patterns
└── architecture-patterns-template.md # SOLID/DDD patterns
```

## Analytics and Metrics

### Success Metrics
- **Coverage:** 100% of targeted agents enhanced with appropriate best practices
- **Quality:** Enhanced agents maintain response relevance while adding practice guidance
- **Adoption:** Claude Code usage patterns show increased quality in guided implementations
- **Effectiveness:** User satisfaction with enhanced agent guidance remains high or improves

### Tracking Requirements

Since this enhances sub-agent definitions rather than runtime systems, metrics will focus on:

| Metric Type | Description | Measurement |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Enhancement Coverage** | Percentage of agents with best practices integrated | File analysis of agent definitions |
| **Practice Distribution** | Coverage of practices across agent categories | Template application verification |
| **Agent Length Management** | Enhanced agents stay within acceptable limits | Line count analysis |
| **Consistency Validation** | Similar practices applied consistently | Cross-agent practice alignment check |

## Release Strategy

### MVP Scope
Enhance core code-writing agents with fundamental practices:
- TDD workflow integration (5 agents)
- Basic security practices (6 agents) 
- SOLID principles integration (3 agents)
- Template system for systematic enhancement

### Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1:** Core code-writing agents (backend, frontend, QA) - Foundational practices
2. **Phase 2:** Architecture and infrastructure agents - Design and operational practices  
3. **Phase 3:** Specialized agents (ML, mobile, performance) - Domain-specific practices

### Deployment Strategy
- **Method:** Direct file enhancement in `assets/claude/agents/`
- **Validation:** Template-based consistency checking
- **Testing:** Compare enhanced agent responses with existing baselines
- **Rollback:** Git-based version control for definition files

## Risks and Dependencies

| Risk/Dependency | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Agent definition length exceeds maintainable limits | Medium impact on usability | Template-driven approach with length monitoring |
| Enhanced practices conflict with agent personalities | High impact on effectiveness | Preserve personality while embedding practices naturally |
| Practice integration reduces agent response quality | High impact on user experience | Pilot testing with response quality validation |
| Template system complexity increases maintenance burden | Low ongoing impact | Simple template patterns, clear documentation |

## Open Questions

- [ ] What are the acceptable length limits for enhanced agent definitions?
- [ ] Should enhancement templates be agent-specific or category-based?
- [ ] How should conflicting practices be prioritized when integrating across domains?
- [ ] What validation approach should ensure enhanced agents maintain effectiveness?
- [ ] Should practice integration be gradual or comprehensive for each agent?
