## Product Overview

### Vision
Create a systematic, evidence-based approach to optimize agent ecosystems that reduces complexity while preserving specialized capabilities and follows research-backed design principles.

### Problem Statement
The current 57+ agent ecosystem creates maintenance burden, user confusion, and potential functional overlap. Without systematic analysis, organizations face "agent sprawl" - uncontrolled proliferation leading to 60% higher maintenance overhead, decision paralysis for users choosing between similar agents, and degraded system performance from coordination complexity. The consequences include reduced developer productivity, inconsistent user experiences, and technical debt accumulation.

### Value Proposition
This solution provides objective, framework-driven agent consolidation recommendations that deliver 25-40% reduction in agent count while maintaining 100% functional coverage. Based on industry research showing 60% maintenance overhead reduction and 20-40% performance improvements, it enables faster agent selection, clearer capability boundaries, and systematic preservation of specialized expertise - transforming agent chaos into purposeful architecture.

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Duplication Detection Engine
**Description:** The core engine that automatically analyzes all agent definition files to identify functional overlap using established framework criteria. It parses agent metadata, descriptions, focus areas, and capabilities to calculate similarity scores and confidence levels.

**User Flow:**
1. User initiates full ecosystem scan or targets specific agent subset
2. System parses all agent definition files in assets/claude/agents/**/*.md
3. System extracts and normalizes agent capabilities, focus areas, and deliverables
4. System calculates activity overlap percentages using established duplication framework
5. System generates confidence-scored recommendations with detailed justification
6. User reviews findings with drill-down capability into specific overlap areas
7. User exports results for stakeholder review and decision-making

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: When activity overlap exceeds 80%, mark as "High Confidence" duplication candidate
- Rule 2: When deliverable overlap exceeds 70% AND context requirements overlap exceeds 80%, flag for consolidation review
- Rule 3: When framework-specific agents are detected doing same activity, mark as violation of activity-based organization
- Rule 4: Preserve all agent metadata and original definitions during analysis (read-only operations)
- Rule 5: Generate audit trail of all analysis decisions and scoring rationale

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: Agent files contain malformed YAML or missing sections → Expected: Log warnings but continue analysis with available data
- Scenario 2: Legitimate specializations appear similar due to naming → Expected: Use deeper semantic analysis of focus areas and exclusions
- Scenario 3: Framework detection fails or is ambiguous → Expected: Flag for manual review rather than auto-classify
- Scenario 4: Large agent ecosystem (100+ agents) causes performance issues → Expected: Implement batching and progress indicators
