## Product Overview

### Vision
Create a streamlined, activity-based agent architecture that reduces cognitive load and improves performance while maintaining all essential capabilities.

### Problem Statement
The current 61-agent structure contains 30-40% duplications and overlaps, creating confusion for users about which agent to select, violating Single Responsibility Principle, and causing performance degradation from unnecessary context switching. Users waste time deciding between similar agents and experience slower performance due to the cognitive overhead.

### Value Proposition
A consolidated agent architecture that eliminates duplications, follows activity-based organization principles from PRINCIPLES.md, reduces the total number of agents to a meaningful set, and maintains all essential capabilities while improving clarity of agent selection.

## Target Users

Users of Claude Code who work with the agent system and need:
- Clear understanding of which agent to use for specific tasks
- Reduced confusion from overlapping agent responsibilities
- Activity-based organization following software engineering principles

## Problem Examples

### Current State Issues
- **Multiple similar agents:** e.g., api-design, api-documentation, service-integration all touch API work
- **Unclear boundaries:** Hard to know where one agent's responsibility ends and another begins
- **Violations of principles:** Not following Single Responsibility or activity-based organization

### Desired State After Consolidation
- **Clear agent selection:** e.g., single "api-developer" agent for all API-related work
- **Activity-based organization:** Agents named and organized by what they DO
- **Principles compliance:** Following PRINCIPLES.md guidelines

## Feature Requirements

### Must Have Features

  - [ ] Eliminate all identified duplications (80% CI/CD overlap, 70% data modeling overlap, etc.)
  - [ ] Maintain all existing capabilities across consolidated agents
  - [ ] Follow activity-based organization (what agents DO, not WHO they are)

#### Feature 2: Activity-Based Agent Architecture
- **User Story:** As a user, I want agents organized by activities rather than roles so that agent selection becomes intuitive
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] All agents follow "what they DO" naming convention
  - [ ] Clear FOCUS areas for each agent
  - [ ] Explicit EXCLUDE boundaries to prevent scope creep
  - [ ] Framework-agnostic implementations with adaptation patterns

  - [ ] Backward compatibility during transition period
  - [ ] Clear mapping from old agents to new consolidated agents
  - [ ] Migration documentation and guidance
  - [ ] Gradual rollout with rollback capability

### Should Have Features

#### Feature 4: Improved Organization
- **User Story:** As a user, I want clearer agent organization so that I can find the right agent quickly
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Agents organized by activity (what they DO)
  - [ ] Reduced confusion from duplicate agents
  - [ ] Clearer boundaries between agent responsibilities

#### Feature 5: Usage Analytics
- **User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track which consolidated agents are most used so that we can validate the consolidation decisions
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Track agent usage frequency
  - [ ] Monitor consolidation success metrics
  - [ ] Identify any usage gaps or unexpected patterns

### Could Have Features

#### Feature 6: Smart Agent Recommendations
- **User Story:** As a user, I want the system to suggest relevant agents based on my task description so that agent selection becomes even faster
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Context-aware agent suggestions
  - [ ] Learning from user patterns
  - [ ] Integration with task description analysis

### Won't Have (This Phase)

- Custom agent creation tools (focus on consolidating existing agents)
- Agent chaining workflows (separate from consolidation effort)
- Multi-language agent definitions (English only for this phase)

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Agent Consolidation Engine

**Description:** Core system that merges duplicate agents into focused, activity-based agents while preserving all capabilities.

**User Flow:**
1. User requests agent for specific task (e.g., "I need API help")
2. System routes to single consolidated agent (api-developer)
3. Agent provides comprehensive output covering full activity scope
4. User receives complete solution without needing multiple agents

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Each consolidated agent must maintain ALL capabilities of its constituent agents
- Rule 2: No functionality can be lost during consolidation
- Rule 3: Agent boundaries must follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Rule 4: All agents must be framework-agnostic with specific adaptations

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: User requests deprecated agent → Expected: Redirect to appropriate consolidated agent with explanation
- Scenario 2: Task spans multiple consolidated agents → Expected: Clear guidance on which agents to use in sequence
- Scenario 3: Consolidated agent has conflicting guidance from source agents → Expected: Prioritize most common/best practice approach

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Agent Reduction:** Reduce to meaningful set (analysis shows 61 → 33 possible)
- **Duplication Elimination:** All identified overlaps resolved
- **Principles Compliance:** All consolidations follow PRINCIPLES.md
- **Capability Preservation:** All unique capabilities maintained
- **Documentation Clarity:** Clear rationale for each consolidation

### Tracking Requirements

| Event | Properties | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| agent_selected | agent_id, user_context, task_type | Track which agents are used most |
| agent_execution_time | agent_id, duration, success | Monitor performance improvements |
| consolidation_redirect | old_agent, new_agent, user_acceptance | Validate migration success |
| user_confusion_indicators | multiple_agents_tried, task_type | Identify remaining confusion points |

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must follow docs/PRINCIPLES.md for all consolidations
- Cannot lose unique agent capabilities during consolidation
- Must work with existing agent file format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown)
- Focus only on assets/claude/agents directory

### Assumptions
- Agents with overlapping activities can be meaningfully consolidated
- Activity-based organization will be clearer than current structure
- The identified duplications are accurate based on analysis

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Loss of specialized functionality | High | Low | Comprehensive testing and capability mapping |
| User resistance to change | Medium | Medium | Clear communication and migration docs |
| Performance degradation from larger agents | Medium | Low | Performance testing and optimization |
| Confusion during transition period | Medium | High | Gradual rollout with clear guidance |
| Rollback complexity | High | Low | Maintain parallel systems during transition |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we implement gradual rollout or full replacement?
- [ ] How long should backward compatibility period last?
- [ ] What specific user education materials are needed?
- [ ] Should we gather user feedback before finalizing consolidations?

## Supporting Research

### Competitive Analysis

**Leading Agent Repositories Analysis:**
- VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents: 100+ specialized agents with focus on production-ready implementations
- wshobson/agents: 77 expert agents emphasizing comprehensive enhancement with 2024/2025 best practices
- zhsama/claude-sub-agent: Workflow automation through agent coordination patterns

**Key Patterns Identified:**
- Single Responsibility Principle consistently applied
- Clear boundaries between agent domains
- Explicit expertise statements
- Flexible, goal-oriented approaches
- Activity-based rather than role-based organization

### Analysis Research

**Duplication Analysis Findings:**
- Multiple agents have significant overlaps in their activities
- Highest duplications found: CI/CD + Deployment overlap, Solution Research + Technology Evaluation nearly identical
- Cross-cutting concerns (performance, testing, deployment) duplicated across multiple domains
- Clear violations of Single Responsibility Principle identified

**Activity Mapping Analysis:**
- Software Development: 13 agents could consolidate to 6
- Platform Engineering: 11 agents could consolidate to 7
- Architecture/Analysis: 12 agents could consolidate to 5
- Total potential reduction: 61 → 33 agents

### Design Principles Research

**From PRINCIPLES.md:**
- Multi-agent systems benefit from specialized agents (research cited: 2.86%-21.88% improvements)
- Activity-based organization preferred (what agents DO, not WHO they are)
- Single Responsibility Principle must guide agent boundaries
- Separation of concerns reduces context pollution
- Framework-agnostic design enables better reusability
- Modular composability allows complex workflows
