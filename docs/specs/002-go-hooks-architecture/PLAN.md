# Implementation Plan (IP)
**Project:** Go Hooks Architecture Migration  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Author:** the-project-manager  
**Complexity:** Medium

## Execution Rules for Main Agent

### How to Read This Document
This implementation plan uses a checklist format optimized for LLM execution while remaining human-readable.

### Phase Execution Types
- **parallel**: All tasks in the phase can be executed simultaneously
  - Invoke multiple agents at once using batch Task tool calls
  - Monitor all parallel executions
  - Wait for all to complete before proceeding
  
- **sequential**: Tasks must be completed in the order listed
  - Complete each task fully before starting the next
  - Pass outputs from previous tasks as context to subsequent tasks
  - Stop on any failures

### Task Annotations
Each task line contains:
1. **Checkbox**: `- [ ]` tracks completion status
2. **Task description**: What needs to be done
3. **Agent assignment**: `{agent: specialist-name}` 
4. **Source reference**: `[→ doc#section]` links to requirements

Example:
```
- [ ] Implement user authentication {agent: developer} [→ PRD#auth-requirements]
```

### Subtasks
Indented items are subtasks that should be included in the agent's prompt:
```
- [ ] Main task {agent: developer}
  - [ ] Subtask 1 (include in prompt)
  - [ ] Subtask 2 (include in prompt)
```

### Validation Checkpoints
**Validation** tasks use available project commands to verify progress:
```
- [ ] **Validation**: go test ./..., go build
```

### Status Tracking
As you execute:
- Mark `- [ ]` as `- [x]` when complete
- Update the status in memory/context
- Report progress to user periodically

### Available Commands
```bash
# Go Development
go mod tidy              # Update dependencies
go build                 # Build project
go test ./...            # Run all tests
go test -v ./...         # Run tests with verbose output
go run main.go           # Run locally

# Validation
go fmt ./...             # Format code
go vet ./...             # Static analysis
golangci-lint run        # Advanced linting
```

## Dynamic Task Addition

When adding new tasks during execution:

  - **Reason**: [Why this was added]
  - **Dependencies**: [What must complete first]
```

## Rollback Plan

If Go hook deployment fails:
1. {agent: devops} Revert to Python hooks in settings.json
2. {agent: site-reliability-engineer} Diagnose Go hook failure
3. {agent: developer} Fix identified issues  
4. {agent: project-manager} Resume from appropriate phase

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks Identified:
- **JSON Compatibility**: Strict schema validation and comprehensive testing
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test on Linux/macOS/Windows during development
- **Performance Regression**: Benchmark against current Python implementation
- **Migration Complexity**: Implement thorough rollback and validation procedures

### Success Metrics:
- Startup time <10ms (vs ~100ms Python)
- Memory usage <5MB additional (vs ~30MB Python processes)
- Zero compatibility issues with existing JSONL format
- Successful removal of Python/uv dependency requirement
