# Business Requirements Document: Context Management System

## Executive Summary

The current implementation of the-startup's agent orchestration system lacks persistent context management, creating a fundamental limitation where agents cannot access or build upon previous work. This prevents true stateful agent behavior and continuity across sessions, reducing the system's effectiveness for complex, iterative development tasks.

The proposed context management system transforms the current stateless agents into stateful agents with memory persistence, enabling them to load previous context, continue interrupted work, and maintain conversational continuity. This system implements the sophisticated context management architecture described in RESEARCH.md, bridging the gap between the current basic logging and the envisioned intelligent agent instance management.

## Business Problem Definition

### What Problem Are We Solving?
Agents in the-startup system currently cannot access previous context or continue from where they left off, forcing users to restart complex workflows from scratch and preventing agents from building iteratively on their previous analysis or implementation work.

### Who Is Affected?
- Primary users: Software developers and teams using the-startup for project orchestration
- Impact: Significant workflow inefficiency, loss of previous work, inability to iterate on complex requirements

**Stakeholder Matrix:**
| Stakeholder | Role | Interest/Impact | Requirements |
|-------------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Main/Orchestrator Agent | System coordinator | High - needs session state management | Conversation history, instance tracking, resume capability |
| Sub-Agents (BA, Architect, Developer) | Specialized workers | High - need access to their previous work | Context loading, append capabilities, instance isolation |
| Software Developers | End users | High - expect agent continuity | Seamless experience, work persistence, iteration support |
| Claude Code Integration | Platform | Medium - hook system constraints | Compatible with existing PreToolUse/PostToolUse events |

### Why Now?
The current logging implementation captures agent events but doesn't enable agent memory, representing a critical gap between the system's architecture vision (RESEARCH.md) and actual functionality. Users are experiencing frustration with agents that "forget" previous conversations.

### Success Looks Like
- [ ] Agents successfully load and reference previous context when reused
- [ ] Users can iterate and refine agent work across multiple sessions
- [ ] Parallel agent instances work independently without context collision
- [ ] System provides clear audit trail of agent decisions and context evolution

**Key Performance Indicators:**
1. Agent Context Load Success Rate: >95% successful context retrieval when available
2. User Session Continuity: Users can resume work after interruption without data loss
3. System Performance: Context loading doesn't increase agent response time by more than 2 seconds

## Business Objectives
1. **Primary Objective:** Enable agent memory and context persistence
   - Success Criteria: Agents can load and use previous context from their instance files
   - Business Value: Enables iterative development workflows and reduces redundant work

2. **Secondary Objectives:**
   - Maintain backward compatibility with current logging system
   - Support parallel agent execution without context interference
   - Provide foundation for advanced orchestration workflows

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| FR01 | Agent instance management with unique identifiers | Must | Each agent invocation creates or reuses an AgentId-based context file |
| FR02 | Context reading capability via enhanced log command | Must | Agents can execute `log --read` to load previous context |
| FR03 | Individual agent instance JSONL files | Must | Each agent gets separate context file: .the-startup/[sessionId]/[agentId].jsonl |
| FR04 | Agent instruction updates for context loading | Must | All agent templates include context discovery and loading logic |
| FR05 | Session-based context organization | Must | Context organized by Claude Code session ID with fallback detection |
| FR06 | Context writing and appending | Must | New agent interactions append to existing context files |
| FR07 | Orchestrator context management | Should | Main orchestrator maintains conversation log in main.jsonl |
| FR08 | Session resumption capability | Should | Users can resume work from previous sessions |
| FR09 | Instance reuse logic | Could | System intelligently decides when to create new vs reuse existing instances |

### Non-Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| NR01 | Performance - Context loading efficiency | Must | Context loading completes within 2 seconds for files <10MB |
| NR02 | Compatibility - Backward compatibility | Must | Current agent-instructions.jsonl and global logging continue to work |
| NR03 | Reliability - Concurrent access safety | Must | Multiple agents can write to different files simultaneously without corruption |
| NR04 | Usability - Transparent operation | Should | Context management works without user intervention |
| NR05 | Scalability - Large context handling | Should | System handles context files up to 50MB with graceful degradation |

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions
- Claude Code's hook system (PreToolUse/PostToolUse) provides necessary data for context management
- AgentIds can be reliably extracted from or embedded in agent prompts
- JSONL format is suitable for agent context representation and loading

### Dependencies
- Existing log command functionality and hook integration
- Claude Code session ID availability through environment or input data
- File system access for reading/writing context files in .the-startup directory

## Risks and Mitigation

| ID | Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| RI01 | Context files become too large for efficient loading | High | Medium | Implement context truncation/summarization for files >10MB |
| RI02 | AgentId extraction fails, preventing proper instance management | High | Low | Implement fallback AgentId generation with timestamp/hash |
| RI03 | Claude Code hook limitations prevent full context integration | Medium | Medium | Design system to work within existing hook constraints, extend incrementally |
| RI04 | File corruption from concurrent access | Medium | Low | Implement proper file locking and atomic write operations |
| RI05 | Performance degradation with many context files | Medium | Medium | Optimize file I/O, implement lazy loading, add context cleanup |

## Constraints
- **Timeline:** Must work within Claude Code's existing hook system without platform modifications
- **Resources:** Implementation must use Go language and existing codebase structure
- **Organizational:** Must maintain backward compatibility with current logging functionality
- **Security/Compliance:** Context files may contain sensitive project information, require appropriate file permissions
- **Technical:** Limited to functionality available through PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook events
