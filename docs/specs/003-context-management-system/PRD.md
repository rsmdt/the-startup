# Product Requirements Document: Context Management System

## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform the-startup's agents from stateless workers into intelligent, context-aware collaborators that remember, learn, and build upon their previous interactions.

### Problem Statement
Software development teams using the-startup system experience workflow disruption when agents cannot remember previous context, forcing users to restart complex tasks from scratch and preventing iterative development workflows that rely on agent memory and continuity.

### Value Proposition
Stateful agent behavior that enables true iterative development workflows, reduces redundant work, and provides seamless context continuity across sessions, transforming the-startup into a persistent development companion rather than a collection of isolated tools.

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Development Team Lead
- **Demographics:** 5-10 years experience, technical project management, moderate CLI comfort
- **Goals:** Orchestrate complex multi-step development tasks, maintain project momentum across sessions
- **Pain Points:** Loses agent context between sessions, has to re-explain requirements, cannot resume interrupted workflows
- **User Story:** As a development team lead, I want agents to remember our previous conversations and work so that I can iterate and refine requirements across multiple sessions without starting over.

### Secondary Persona: Solo Developer
- **Demographics:** 2-15 years experience, high technical skills, heavy CLI usage
- **Goals:** Leverage AI agents for complex architecture and implementation tasks
- **Pain Points:** Agent "amnesia" interrupts complex reasoning chains, loses architectural decisions
- **User Story:** As a solo developer, I want to continue deep technical conversations with specialized agents so that I can build complex systems through iterative refinement.

### Secondary Persona: Agent (System Persona)
- **Demographics:** AI agent instance (architect, developer, business analyst)
- **Goals:** Maintain context awareness, provide consistent recommendations, build upon previous work
- **Pain Points:** Cannot access previous analysis, repeats work, provides inconsistent advice
- **User Story:** As an agent, I want to access my previous interactions and decisions so that I can provide consistent, building recommendations rather than contradictory fresh starts.

## User Journey Maps

### Context-Aware Development Workflow
1. **Initiation:** Developer starts complex task, agents begin with context discovery
2. **Iteration:** Work proceeds with agents building on previous context and decisions
3. **Interruption:** Session ends, context automatically persists
4. **Resumption:** New session begins, agents automatically load relevant context
5. **Completion:** Task completes with full audit trail of agent reasoning evolution

### Agent Context Loading Journey
1. **Invocation:** Agent receives task, immediately attempts context discovery
2. **Context Loading:** System retrieves relevant previous interactions automatically
3. **Context Integration:** Agent incorporates previous context into current reasoning
4. **Work Execution:** Agent performs task with full awareness of history
5. **Context Updating:** Agent's new work automatically persists for future sessions

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Agent Instance Identification
**Description:** Each agent invocation creates or reuses a unique identifier that persists across interactions, enabling isolated context management for parallel agent execution.

**User Flow:**
1. Agent receives task with potential AgentId in prompt
2. System extracts AgentId using regex pattern matching
3. If no AgentId found, system generates deterministic fallback
4. AgentId used for all subsequent context file operations

**Business Rules:**
- AgentId format: alphanumeric with hyphens (e.g., "arch-001", "dev-feature-auth")
- Generated AgentIds follow pattern: [agent-type]-[timestamp-hash]
- AgentIds must be unique within session scope
- AgentId extraction prioritizes explicit prompt values over generation

**Edge Cases:**
- Malformed AgentId in prompt → Use generation fallback
- Duplicate AgentId in same session → Append disambiguator
- Agent prompt without type information → Use generic prefix

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- AgentId extraction operates transparently
- Debug mode shows AgentId selection process
- Error conditions logged but don't interrupt agent execution

### Feature: Context Reading Capability
**Description:** Enhanced log command that allows agents to retrieve their previous context through a standardized interface, enabling memory-based agent behavior.

**User Flow:**
1. Agent template includes context discovery instruction
2. Agent executes `the-startup log --read --agent-id <id> --lines <n>`
3. System locates agent's context file in current/latest session
4. Recent context entries returned as formatted JSONL
5. Agent incorporates context into working memory

**Business Rules:**
- Default to latest session if no session specified
- Return up to specified number of recent entries (default 50)
- Include both agent_start and agent_complete events
- Silent failure when no context available (enables fresh start)
- Context reading doesn't modify existing files

**Edge Cases:**
- Missing context file → Return empty result silently
- Corrupted JSONL entries → Skip corrupted, return valid entries
- Very large context files → Implement efficient tail reading
- Concurrent read/write access → Use existing file locking

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Command-line interface consistent with existing log command
- JSONL output compatible with agent parsing
- Performance target: <2 seconds for files under 10MB
- Memory-efficient processing for large contexts

### Feature: Session-Based Context Organization
**Description:** Hierarchical file organization that groups agent contexts by Claude Code session, enabling temporal organization and session-based resumption.

**User Flow:**
1. System detects current session from environment or hook data
2. Context files created in session-specific directories
3. Directory structure: `.the-startup/[session-id]/[agent-id].jsonl`
4. Session resumption automatically accesses previous session contexts

**Business Rules:**
- Session ID detection priority: environment variable → hook data → latest directory
- Session directories created automatically as needed
- Main orchestrator context stored in `main.jsonl` within session
- Backward compatibility files continue in session directory

**Edge Cases:**
- Missing session information → Generate session ID with timestamp
- Session directory creation fails → Fall back to root directory
- Cross-session agent context access → Implement session lookup

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Directory structure intuitive for manual inspection
- File naming convention consistent and predictable
- Session organization transparent to end users
- Context access works seamlessly across session boundaries

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should orchestrator agents have special context sharing capabilities with sub-agents?
- [ ] What is the optimal default number of context lines to load for agent performance?
- [ ] Should we implement automatic context summarization for very large context files?
- [ ] How should we handle context migration when agent templates evolve significantly?
- [ ] Should context files have automatic expiration or archival policies?

### Mockups/Wireframes
```
Context File Structure:
.the-startup/
├── dev-20250812-143022/
│   ├── main.jsonl                    # Orchestrator context
│   ├── arch-001.jsonl               # Architect instance
│   ├── dev-feature-auth.jsonl       # Developer instance
│   └── agent-instructions.jsonl     # Backward compatibility
├── dev-20250811-091455/             # Previous session
│   └── [agent files...]
└── all-agent-instructions.jsonl     # Global log
```

### Context Loading Flow Example
```bash
# Agent template includes:
CONTEXT=$(the-startup log --read --agent-id arch-001 --lines 20 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$CONTEXT" ]; then
    echo "Loading previous context..."
    # Process context for agent reasoning
fi
```

### Competitive Analysis
Current solution provides stateless agents similar to basic ChatGPT sessions. Enhanced system moves toward persistent AI assistants like Anthropic's Claude Projects or OpenAI's custom GPTs, but focused specifically on development workflows rather than general conversation.

### Research Data
From BRD analysis: Users report significant frustration with "forgetful" agents and workflow interruption. Key insight: development tasks naturally span multiple sessions and require iterative refinement, making context persistence a critical capability rather than a convenience feature.
