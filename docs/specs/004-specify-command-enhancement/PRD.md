# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform `/s:specify` into an intelligent orchestrator using Microsoft's handoff pattern to dynamically route tasks based on complexity assessment.

### Problem Statement
The current `/s:specify` command forces ALL tasks to sub-agents regardless of complexity (line 13: "You MUST delegate EVERYTHING"). Per Anthropic docs, sub-agents "start off with a clean slate" and "add latency as they gather context," creating unnecessary delays for simple tasks. Users lack control over delegation decisions and receive no clarification when requirements are vague, leading to assumption-based implementations and rework cycles.

### Value Proposition
An intelligent slash command implementing the handoff orchestration pattern (Microsoft Azure) that assesses task complexity and routes appropriately. Simple tasks execute directly while complex work delegates to specialists. Users gain control through asynchronous confirmation gates (AutoGen pattern) and receive proactive clarification for ambiguous requirements.

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Sarah - Simple Task User

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Document Assessment Engine

**Description:** Implement three-tier document classification using "Direct, Design, Discovery" framework

**User Flow:**
1. User provides specification request
2. System analyzes clarity and scope
3. System displays document workflow needed
4. User confirms or overrides decision
5. System delegates to appropriate specialists

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Level 1 "Direct" - Clear requirements get PLAN only
- Rule 2: Level 2 "Design" - Technical/product design needs SDD/PRD
- Rule 3: Level 3 "Discovery" - Vague requirements need BRD first
- Rule 4: Classification based on: clarity, scope, ambiguity level

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario: Ambiguous complexity → Expected: Default to higher level with user prompt
- Scenario: User override → Expected: Honor user choice for this instance

**Text Display Requirements:**
- Display document needs using tree structure
- Show "Direct/Design/Discovery" classification clearly
- List documents to be created (PLAN, SDD→PLAN, etc.)
- Use emoji indicators for workflow stages

### Feature: User Control Gates

**Description:** Implement mandatory checkpoints per Research Finding 3 (RESEARCH.md, User Interaction Patterns)

**User Flow:**
1. System reaches decision point
2. Displays "🛑 Confirmation Required" with context
3. Shows options: proceed/modify/clarify/cancel
4. User selects action
5. System continues based on selection

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: ALL sub-agent delegations require confirmation
- Rule 2: ALL agent responses require review before continuing
- Rule 3: ALL document transitions require explicit approval
- Rule 4: No automatic progression without user input

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario: User doesn't respond → Expected: Save state, allow resume later
- Scenario: Conflicting agent responses → Expected: Present both with recommendation

**Text Display Requirements:**
- Stop indicator using emoji (🛑) in terminal output
- Options displayed as lettered/numbered text choices
- Context preserved during wait
- Progress shown using markdown formatting

### Feature: Bounded Context Management

**Description:** Implement hierarchical context layering per Research Finding 1 (RESEARCH.md, Context Management Patterns)

**User Flow:**
1. Orchestrator maintains full project context
2. System extracts bounded context for sub-agent (50 words max)
3. Context formatted with: objective, constraints, success criteria
4. Sub-agent receives only necessary information
5. Response integrated back into full context

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Strategic context stays with orchestrator (goals, state, preferences)
- Rule 2: Tactical context to sub-agents (task, constraints, criteria)
- Rule 3: Bounded context to minimize latency (Anthropic: sub-agents "gather context they require")
- Rule 4: Use structured format: role, objective, context, tools, output_schema

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario: Context exceeds limits → Expected: Compress using summary
- Scenario: Missing context detected → Expected: Request from orchestrator

**Text Display Requirements:**
- Show context being sent to sub-agent in code block
- Display context size reduction achieved
- Present option to modify context as text prompt

### Feature: Session Management & Resume

**Description:** Implement session tracking and resume capability leveraging existing hook infrastructure per user requirement for sub-agent context continuity

**User Flow:**
1. Command generates unique SessionID on start
2. System creates state file at `.the-startup/{session-id}/state.md`
3. Sub-agents receive SessionID and AgentID in prompts
4. Agents can retrieve previous context via `the-startup log --read`
5. User can resume interrupted sessions with `--resume {session-id}`

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: SessionID format: `{command}-{timestamp}` (e.g., specify-20250816-142530)
- Rule 2: AgentID format: `{type}-{context}-{seq}` (e.g., ba-auth-001)
- Rule 3: Sub-agents receive instructions to load context, not the context itself
- Rule 4: State file must be markdown-readable via @ notation
- Rule 5: Agent logs accessed only via the-startup command, not @ notation

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario: Resume non-existent session → Expected: Clear error, suggest available sessions
- Scenario: Corrupted state file → Expected: Attempt recovery from logs
- Scenario: Agent ID collision → Expected: Auto-increment sequence number

**Text Display Requirements:**
- Show SessionID prominently at workflow start
- Display AgentID when invoking sub-agents
- Present resume context with full decision history
- Use emoji indicators for session status (📂 resuming, ✅ saved, etc.)

### Research Data

#### Industry Research Findings

##### Finding 1: Orchestration Patterns
**Source**: Microsoft Azure Architecture Center
**URL**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns
**Quote**: "The handoff orchestration pattern enables dynamic delegation of tasks between specialized agents. Each agent can assess the task at hand and decide whether to handle it directly or transfer it to a more appropriate agent based on the context and requirements."
**Date Accessed**: August 14, 2025

**Key Patterns Identified**:
1. Sequential Pattern: Agents execute in predetermined order
2. Concurrent Pattern: Multiple agents work simultaneously
3. Group Chat Pattern: Agents collaborate through discussion
4. Handoff Pattern: Dynamic delegation based on task assessment
5. Magnetic Pattern: Agents attract based on capability matching

**Implication**: The handoff pattern directly supports intelligent routing - the orchestrator can assess complexity and decide whether to handle directly or delegate to specialists.

##### Finding 2: Context Management in Claude Code
**Source**: Anthropic Official Documentation
**URL**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
**Quote**: "Subagents help preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions, though subagents start off with a clean slate each time they are invoked and may add latency as they gather context they require."
**Date Accessed**: August 14, 2025

**Key Insights**:
- Sub-agents start with clean slate (no inherited context)
- Main agent context is preserved when using sub-agents
- Latency increases as sub-agents gather required context
- Trade-off between context preservation and performance

**Implication**: Must provide bounded, focused context to sub-agents since they start fresh. The main `/s:specify` command should maintain project narrative while passing only essential context to sub-agents.

##### Finding 3: Orchestration Efficiency
**Source**: IBM Research
**URL**: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agent-orchestration
**Quote**: "Without orchestration, these agents might work in isolation, leading to inefficiencies, redundancies or gaps in execution."
**Date Accessed**: August 14, 2025

**Key Points**:
- Isolated agents create inefficiencies and redundancies
- Orchestration prevents gaps in execution
- Coordination is essential for multi-agent effectiveness

**Implication**: The current "delegate everything" approach may be creating the inefficiencies IBM warns about. Intelligent orchestration can prevent redundant work.

##### Finding 4: Stateful Context in LangChain
**Source**: LangChain Documentation
**URL**: https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/
**Quote**: "LangGraph's management and persistence of state simplifies conversational applications enormously."
**Date Accessed**: August 14, 2025

**Framework Features**:
- Thread-specific state tracking
- Conversation memory persistence
- Stateful multi-actor applications
- Simplified context management

**Implication**: Session state persistence and thread-specific tracking align with our need for resume capabilities and context preservation across interactions.

##### Finding 5: Academic Research on Multi-Agent Challenges
**Source**: arXiv Preprint
**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21030
**Quote**: "This research addresses fundamental challenges in context management, coordination efficiency, and scalable operation in multi-agent systems through standardized context sharing and coordination mechanisms via MCP."
**Author**: Naveen Kumar Krishnan
**Date**: April 2025

**Identified Challenges**:
- "Disconnected models problem" - difficulty maintaining coherent context
- Coordination efficiency decreases with agent count
- Scalability issues in multi-agent systems
- Need for standardized context sharing mechanisms

**Implication**: The "disconnected models problem" directly relates to our context drift issue. Standardized context sharing (bounded context format) is a validated approach.

##### Finding 6: Enterprise Multi-Agent Architecture
**Source**: Microsoft Research - AutoGen
**URL**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/
**Quote**: "Agents communicate through asynchronous messages" and supports both "event-driven and request/response interaction patterns"
**Date Accessed**: August 14, 2025

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Asynchronous message-based communication
- Event-driven and request/response patterns
- Cross-language support
- Enterprise-grade observability

**Implication**: Asynchronous patterns with clear request/response support our need for user confirmation gates and controlled workflow progression.

#### Areas Where No Sources Were Found

##### Token Overhead Metrics
**Finding**: NO SOURCE FOUND for specific, quantifiable token overhead in multi-agent systems.
**Hypothesis**: Based on the clean-slate nature of sub-agents (Anthropic documentation), we hypothesize significant overhead exists but cannot quantify it without empirical testing.
**Recommendation**: Implement measurement in our solution to gather real metrics.

##### Performance Benchmarks
**Finding**: NO SOURCE FOUND for comparative performance data between orchestration patterns.
**Hypothesis**: Direct execution should be faster than delegation based on latency mentioned in Anthropic docs, but quantification requires testing.
**Recommendation**: Establish baseline measurements before and after implementation.

##### User Interaction Patterns
**Finding**: NO SOURCE FOUND for empirical studies on optimal user interaction patterns in AI orchestration.
**Hypothesis**: User control points (confirmation gates) likely improve satisfaction but may impact workflow speed.
**Recommendation**: A/B testing with different interaction patterns.

##### Complexity Classification Thresholds
**Finding**: NO SOURCE FOUND for validated complexity assessment criteria.
**Hypothesis**: Task complexity likely correlates with:
- Number of domains involved
- Ambiguity in requirements
- Need for creative solutions
- Dependencies between components
**Recommendation**: Start with heuristic rules, refine based on user feedback.

#### Architectural Recommendations Based on Research

##### 1. Context Distribution Architecture

**Main Agent Context (Stateful)**
Based on LangChain's stateful orchestration pattern, the main agent should maintain:
- **Project Narrative**: The full story of what's being built, including all decisions made
- **User Preferences**: Settings, choices, and overrides throughout the session
- **Document Relationships**: How BRD→PRD→SDD→PLAN connect and build on each other
- **Session State**: Progress tracking, completed tasks, next steps
- **Global Constraints**: Security requirements, tech stack, business rules that affect all work
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Patterns, standards, and conventions that span components

**Sub-Agent Context (Stateless)**
Based on Anthropic's clean-slate constraint and academic research on standardized context sharing:
```
TASK: [Single specific objective - 1 sentence max]
CONTEXT: [Essential background only - 3 sentences max]
CONSTRAINTS: 
- [Hard boundary 1]
- [Hard boundary 2]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [What constitutes completion]
EXCLUDE: [What to explicitly NOT consider or design]
```

**Rationale**: This split follows the LangGraph pattern (stateful orchestrator) while respecting Anthropic's constraint (stateless sub-agents) and addressing the academic "disconnected models problem" through standardized bounded context.

##### 2. Anti-Drift and Anti-Assumption Protocols

**Clarification-First Protocol**
Based on Microsoft AutoGen's asynchronous patterns:
1. **STOP** - When ambiguity detected, do not proceed with assumptions
2. **IDENTIFY** - List specific missing information as numbered questions
3. **ASK** - Present questions to user with context
4. **WAIT** - No progress until answers received (no timeout auto-proceed)
5. **CONFIRM** - Echo understanding back to user before proceeding

**Boundary Enforcement**
Based on academic research addressing the "disconnected models problem":
- Every sub-agent invocation MUST include an EXCLUDE section
- Every sub-agent invocation MUST include a SCOPE section
- Success criteria must be measurable and specific
- Out-of-scope responses should trigger alerts, not assumptions

**Validation Gates**
Based on IBM's efficiency principles:
- Pre-delegation: User confirms routing decision
- Post-response: User validates agent stayed in bounds
- Transition: User approves moving to next phase

##### 3. State Management Strategy

**Leveraging Existing Hook System**
Our existing logging mechanism (`internal/log/processor.go`) already provides:
- SessionId for thread tracking
- AgentId for delegation tracking
- Pre/Post tool use events with full context

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Pre-Delegation Logging**: Capture complexity assessment, user override, bounded context sent
2. **Post-Response Logging**: Capture full response, drift detection, user decisions
3. **Session Reconstruction**: Read from `.the-startup/<session-id>/agent-instructions.jsonl`
4. **Resume Capability**: Rebuild state from logs to continue interrupted workflows

This aligns with LangChain's stateful persistence pattern while using our existing infrastructure.

##### 4. Complexity Assessment Framework

**Three-Level Classification** (heuristic, pending validation):

**Level 1 - Direct Execution**:
- Single technical domain
- Clear, unambiguous requirements
- Standard patterns available
- No creative problem-solving needed
- Example: "Add a submit button to the form"

**Level 2 - Consultation**:
- 2-3 technical domains
- Some clarification needed
- Moderate pattern adaptation
- Some creative elements
- Example: "Add user authentication with email verification"

**Level 3 - Full Delegation**:
- Multiple domains (4+)
- Significant ambiguity
- Novel solution required
- Complex dependencies
- Example: "Design real-time collaboration system"

**Note**: These thresholds are hypothetical as no research provided validated criteria. Must be refined through usage.

#### Implementation Strategy Summary

1. **Use Handoff Pattern**: Implement Microsoft's validated pattern for dynamic routing
2. **Provide Bounded Context**: Follow academic standardized format to address disconnected models
3. **Maintain State in Orchestrator**: Use LangChain pattern with our hook system
4. **Add Confirmation Gates**: Implement AutoGen asynchronous patterns for user control
5. **Measure Everything**: Collect metrics on areas where research provided no data

This research-backed approach transforms `/s:specify` from a rigid delegator into an intelligent orchestrator that respects user time, control, and intent while following proven industry patterns.
