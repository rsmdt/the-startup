# Product Requirements Document: Agent Specialization Refactoring

## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform The Startup's agent system from broad role-based agents to specialized activity-based agents that deliver 2.86%-21.88% performance improvements through focused expertise.

### Problem Statement
Current agents are too broad (25 generalist agents covering multiple responsibilities), leading to:
- **Context pollution**: Agents receive irrelevant information that degrades focus
- **Suboptimal performance**: Generalist agents underperform compared to specialized alternatives
- **Missed parallel opportunities**: Broad scope prevents concurrent execution of independent tasks
- **Unclear boundaries**: Overlapping responsibilities create coordination challenges

### Value Proposition
Specialized agents deliver superior results through:
- **Focused expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific activity areas
- **Enhanced performance**: Research-backed 2.86%-21.88% improvement in task completion
- **Parallel execution**: Independent agents can work concurrently on complex tasks
- **Clear handoff points**: Defined boundaries enable better orchestration

## User Personas

## User Journey Maps

### Complex Feature Development Journey
1. **Analysis Phase:** Product team uses specialized analyst agents to clarify requirements, research solutions, and document specifications
2. **Design Phase:** Architecture agents create system designs while security agents review for vulnerabilities in parallel
3. **Implementation Phase:** Multiple specialized developer agents work concurrently on APIs, UI components, and data layers
4. **Quality Phase:** Specialized QA agents validate different aspects (security, performance, functionality) simultaneously
5. **Deployment Phase:** Platform agents handle orchestrated deployment while monitoring agents establish observability

### Single-Task Specialization Journey
1. **Task Identification:** User identifies specific need (e.g., "Design REST API for user management")
2. **Agent Selection:** System routes to `the-software-engineer/api-design` specialist
3. **Focused Execution:** Agent provides deep expertise without irrelevant context
4. **Quality Output:** Receives implementation-ready API specification with clear next steps
5. **Seamless Handoff:** Clear boundaries enable smooth transition to implementation agents

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Domain Directory Structure

**Description:** Organize 60 specialized agents into 9 human-readable domain directories while maintaining the-* naming convention.

**User Flow:**
1. User needs specific expertise (e.g., API design)
2. System locates `the-software-engineer/api-design.md`
3. Agent loads with focused context for API design activity
4. User receives specialized expertise without irrelevant information

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Domain folders use role-based naming (the-software-engineer/, the-designer/)
- Rule 2: Agent files use activity-based naming (api-design.md, user-research.md)
- Rule 3: Each agent has single, focused responsibility
- Rule 4: Framework-agnostic patterns required for all agents

**Edge Cases:**
- Cross-domain activities → Route to most appropriate domain with clear boundaries
- Legacy agent names → Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Ambiguous task routing → Escalate to Chief orchestrator for delegation

### Feature: Activity-Based Agent Specialization

**Description:** Transform broad role-based agents (backend-engineer, frontend-engineer) into focused activity specialists (api-design, component-architecture).

**User Flow:**
1. User requests specific activity (e.g., "design database schema")
2. System routes to `the-software-engineer/database-design` specialist
3. Agent focuses exclusively on database design patterns and best practices
4. User receives implementation-ready schema design with migration strategy

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Each agent focuses on what they DO, not who they ARE
- Rule 2: Framework detection adapts patterns to detected technology stack
- Rule 3: Business value connection explicit in all agent outputs
- Rule 4: Clear activity boundaries prevent scope creep

**Edge Cases:**
- Multi-activity tasks → Orchestrator decomposes and coordinates specialists
- Unknown frameworks → Agents provide general patterns with adaptation notes
- Boundary ambiguity → Clear escalation to domain orchestrator

### Feature: Parallel Execution Capability

**Description:** Enable independent agents to execute concurrently on non-conflicting aspects of complex tasks.

**User Flow:**
1. User requests complex task (e.g., "build authentication system")
2. Chief orchestrator analyzes and decomposes task
3. Multiple specialists execute in parallel (API design, UI components, security review)
4. Results synthesized into comprehensive solution

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Only independent activities execute in parallel
- Rule 2: Context isolation prevents information leakage between agents
- Rule 3: Failure of one agent doesn't block others
- Rule 4: Results validated for consistency before synthesis

**Edge Cases:**
- Resource contention → Sequential fallback with clear user notification
- Conflicting recommendations → Orchestrator mediates with business priorities
- Partial failures → Continue with successful agents, flag failures clearly

## Integration Requirements

### Internal System Integration

| System | Purpose | Integration Points | Requirements |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Task Tool | Agent invocation | `subagent_type` parameter processing | Support nested directory paths |
| Hook Processing | Context logging | Agent ID extraction | Handle domain/specialization parsing |
| Asset Loading | Agent discovery | embed.FS scanning | Recursive directory traversal |
| Command System | Orchestration | /s:specify, /s:implement | Enhanced delegation patterns |

---
name: the-[domain]/[activity]
description: [Action verb] [specific outcomes], [key activities]. Use PROACTIVELY when [specific scenarios].
model: inherit
---
```

**Content Structure (flexible):**
- **Personality opener** - Pragmatic focus on delivered outcomes
- **Focus Areas** - What they concentrate on (expand as needed)
- **Approach** - Their methodology (flexible based on complexity)
- **Rules reference** - Domain-appropriate practices
- **Anti-Patterns** - What to avoid (as many as relevant)
- **Expected Output** - What they deliver (expand for clarity)
- **Closing tagline** - Action-oriented summary

### Quality Standards

**Activity-Oriented Focus:**
- ✅ Clear specialization: "designs RESTful APIs with versioning strategies"
- ❌ Role definition: "backend API specialist with extensive experience"

**Framework Agnosticism:**
- ✅ Pattern-based: "component composition patterns that work across frameworks"
- ❌ Technology-specific: "React component architecture using hooks and context"

**Business Value Connection:**
- ✅ Outcome-focused: "creates interfaces developers love to use"
- ❌ Process-focused: "follows API design methodologies"

### Validation Criteria

Each agent must pass:
1. **Clear Activity Focus**: Obvious what this agent specializes in
2. **Framework Agnostic**: Works across different technology stacks  
3. **Implementation Ready**: Outputs lead to actionable next steps
4. **Business Connected**: Value to users/business clearly articulated
5. **Appropriately Scoped**: Neither too broad nor too narrow
6. **Distinct Boundaries**: Clear what this agent does vs doesn't do
