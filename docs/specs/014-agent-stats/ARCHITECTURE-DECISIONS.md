## Decision 1: Multi-Method Agent Detection with Confidence Scoring

**Status**: ⏳ Pending User Confirmation

### Choice Made
Implement a layered agent detection system using three methods with confidence scoring:
- **Task tool detection** (100% confidence): Extract from `subagent_type` parameter
- **Pattern matching** (75-95% confidence): Regex patterns on log content
- **Context inference** (60-80% confidence): Derive from command patterns and context

### Rationale
- **Single method insufficient**: Current Task tool detection only covers ~40% of agent invocations
- **Reliability through confidence**: Transparency about detection accuracy allows users to trust results
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with high-confidence detections, add lower-confidence as patterns improve
- **False positive control**: Confidence thresholds prevent noisy data from degrading analytics quality

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Task tool only**: Simple but misses 60% of agent usage
2. **Pattern matching only**: Higher coverage but less reliable
3. **Machine learning approach**: Over-engineered for terminal analytics tool

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **Complexity**: Additional code for pattern management and confidence calculation
- **Maintenance**: Patterns require updates as agent usage evolves
- **Performance**: ~10% processing overhead for multi-method detection

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance**: Acceptable <10% overhead maintains <200ms response requirement
- **Maintainability**: Pattern registry allows organized pattern updates
- **User Experience**: Confidence indicators build trust in analytics accuracy
- **System Reliability**: 90%+ detection accuracy vs 60% with single method

### User Confirmation Required
- [ ] Approve multi-method detection strategy
- [ ] Confirm confidence score transparency in UI
- [ ] Validate performance trade-off acceptance

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Unlimited memory usage**: Simple but crashes on large datasets
2. **Disk-based storage**: Persistent but adds complexity and dependencies
3. **Sampling approach**: Memory efficient but loses accuracy for rare agents

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **Accuracy loss**: LRU eviction may lose statistics for infrequently used agents
- **Implementation complexity**: Cache management adds significant code complexity
- **Memory bounds**: 100MB limit may require tuning for very large projects

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance**: Maintains <200ms response with bounded resource usage
- **Maintainability**: Cache logic adds complexity but follows standard patterns
- **User Experience**: Transparent performance degradation vs crashes
- **System Reliability**: Prevents OOM crashes on large datasets

### User Confirmation Required
- [ ] Approve bounded memory approach

## Decision 4: Progressive Enhancement UI Strategy

**Status**: ⏳ Pending User Confirmation

### Choice Made
Implement progressive enhancement from CLI to interactive TUI:
- **CLI-first design**: Agent stats work as command-line tables/JSON/CSV
- **Optional TUI mode**: `--interactive` flag launches Bubble Tea dashboard
- **Graceful fallback**: TUI failures fall back to CLI output
- **Feature parity**: Both modes provide same core functionality

### Rationale
- **User choice**: Serves both CLI purists and interactive interface users
- **Risk mitigation**: CLI provides reliable fallback if TUI has issues

- **Development phasing**: CLI implementation validates data layer before UI complexity

### Alternatives Considered
1. **TUI-only approach**: Modern but alienates CLI-focused users
2. **Web dashboard**: Feature-rich but violates terminal-only constraint
3. **CLI-only approach**: Simple but misses opportunity for rich interaction

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **Code duplication**: Display logic exists in both CLI and TUI formats
- **Maintenance overhead**: Two UI paradigms to maintain and test
- **Feature drift**: Risk of CLI and TUI capabilities diverging over time

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance**: CLI mode provides fastest possible response times
- **Maintainability**: Dual UI increases testing surface and complexity
- **User Experience**: Maximum flexibility accommodates different user preferences
- **System Reliability**: CLI fallback ensures functionality under all conditions
