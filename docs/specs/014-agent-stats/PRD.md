## Product Overview

### Vision
Provide comprehensive agent performance analytics that enable users to measure, optimize, and understand their AI agent effectiveness through terminal-native interactive dashboards using the same rich metrics infrastructure as tool analytics.

### Problem Statement
Users currently lack visibility into which agents are actually delivering value in their AI-assisted development workflows. The existing agent stats only provide basic invocation counts from Task tool subagent_type parameters, missing critical performance data like execution duration, success rates, failure pattern analysis, usage patterns, and comparative agent effectiveness metrics. This prevents users from optimizing their agent delegation strategies, identifying ineffective agents, or understanding how agent performance impacts their development velocity and code quality outcomes.

### Value Proposition
Enhanced agent statistics will provide users with the same analytical depth for agents as they currently have for tools - including duration metrics, success rates, failure analysis, temporal usage patterns, and performance comparisons. Unlike generic analytics tools, this solution leverages the existing robust analytics infrastructure while providing AI/LLM-specific insights through terminal-native interactive dashboards (using Charm libraries) that can evolve into btop-style interfaces with sorting, filtering, and terminal-based graphs. This enables data-driven decisions about agent effectiveness and workflow optimization without leaving the development environment.

### Should Have Features
Features that enhance the analytics experience and provide operational insights for advanced users and team leads.

### Could Have Features
Advanced visualization and scoring features that provide sophisticated insights for expert users and researchers.

### Won't Have (This Phase)
**Real-time agent monitoring dashboard** - Conflicts with terminal-native design philosophy

**External system integration (Slack, email alerts)** - Adds complexity without clear user demand
**Machine learning-based anomaly detection** - Adds significant complexity and dependencies

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Agent Performance Leaderboard with Interactive Terminal Interface
**Description:** Terminal-native agent analytics dashboard that displays comprehensive performance metrics, success rates, and usage patterns with progressive enhancement from CLI tables to interactive TUI. Leverages existing analytics infrastructure while providing agent-specific insights comparable to current tool analytics depth.

**User Flow:**
1. User runs `the-startup stats agents` to see basic agent performance table
2. System displays ranked agent list with success rates, usage counts, and sparkline trends
3. User applies filters (`--since 7d`, `--format json`) for specific analysis
4. User runs `the-startup stats agents --interactive` for TUI mode with sorting/filtering
5. System launches Bubble Tea interface with navigable dashboard panels
6. User explores agent delegation patterns and performance comparisons

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Success rate calculation must use same methodology as existing tool analytics
- Rule 2: Agent identification must capture all agent types, not just Task tool subagent_type parameters
- Rule 3: Time filtering must maintain consistency with existing --since patterns
- Rule 4: Output formats (table/JSON/CSV) must follow established formatting standards

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: No agent usage data available → Expected: Display "No agent activity found for time period" with suggestion to check different time range
- Scenario 2: Agent execution still in progress → Expected: Mark as "Running" with elapsed time, exclude from success rate calculation
- Scenario 3: Terminal too small for interactive mode → Expected: Graceful fallback to CLI table format with notification
- Scenario 4: Corrupted log data → Expected: Skip corrupted entries, display warning, continue with valid data

## Success Metrics

- **Historical usage patterns offer valuable insights** for workflow optimization decisions
- **Agent invocations can be reliably inferred** from log patterns beyond current Task tool parsing
- **Users prioritize actionable metrics** over comprehensive analytics requiring complex setup

## Risks and Mitigations
Potential risks and mitigation strategies for successful delivery of enhanced agent analytics.

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data quality issues - agent detection accuracy | High | High | Implement multiple detection methods, confidence scoring, validation mechanisms |
| Performance degradation of stats command | High | Medium | Make analytics opt-in, implement processing time limits, maintain streaming architecture |
| Scope creep beyond MVP capabilities | Medium | High | Define MVP scope clearly, document explicit exclusions, resist predictive features |
| User adoption challenges with CLI complexity | Medium | Medium | Focus on immediately actionable metrics, consistent output format, clear examples |

## Open Questions
Critical decisions requiring stakeholder input before implementation begins.

- [ ] What specific metrics define "enhanced" analytics scope? (Basic usage/success rates vs. effectiveness scoring vs. recommendations)
- [ ] What accuracy level is acceptable for agent detection? (Is 80% sufficient for MVP value?)
- [ ] How should this integrate with existing commands? (New subcommand vs. extension vs. separate tool)
- [ ] What performance impact is tolerable? (2x processing time acceptable? Memory usage limits?)

## Supporting Research

### Competitive Analysis
**GitHub Copilot**: Market leader with web-based analytics, comprehensive ROI tracking, acceptance rate metrics (60-75%), but lacks terminal integration and real-time CLI analytics

**LangSmith**: Leading AI agent platform with step-level tracing and debugging, but web-based with complex setup, not terminal-native

**Terminal Tools (Grafterm, Sampler)**: Real-time metrics visualization, YAML configuration, terminal-native approach, but no AI agent analytics or development workflow insights

**Key Gap**: No terminal-native agent analytics tool specifically designed for Claude Code's ecosystem - significant market opportunity

### User Research
**User Persona Research**: Identified three primary personas - AI-powered developers (individual optimization), engineering team leads (team performance monitoring), and AI/LLM researchers (effectiveness studies)

**Journey Mapping**: Five-stage progression from awareness through retention, with critical decision points around initial value, behavioral change, and measurable impact

**Pain Point Analysis**: Users lack visibility into agent effectiveness beyond basic counts, uncertainty about optimal delegation strategies, no correlation between agent choice and outcomes

### Market Data
**Market Size**: 63% of developers use AI tools with growing Claude Code adoption, millions of AI-assisted developers globally

**Pricing Benchmarks**: Enterprise analytics tools cost $449-599/year per contributor (LinearB, Waydev), creating opportunity for free/low-cost individual developer solution

**Demand Signals**: GitHub Copilot shows 80% license utilization rate indicating strong demand for AI analytics, enterprise need for "agent as knowledge worker" evaluation
