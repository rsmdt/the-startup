# Business Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
The Startup CLI currently processes PLAN.md files containing implementation todos, but todo state changes during command execution remain only in memory. This creates a disconnect between command execution progress and persistent documentation, limiting visibility and collaboration. This specification proposes real-time synchronization of todo states between in-memory TodoWrite operations and PLAN.md files, ensuring progress is preserved, visible, and trackable across sessions and team members.

## Business Problem Definition

### What Problem Are We Solving?
Todo state changes during command execution are lost when commands complete, requiring manual updates to PLAN.md files and creating inconsistency between execution state and documentation.

### Who Is Affected?
- Primary users: Developers using The Startup CLI for implementation
- Impact: 100% of users executing commands with PLAN.md files lose progress visibility

**Stakeholder Matrix:**
| Stakeholder  | Role         | Interest/Impact   | Requirements |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Developers | Primary users | High | Automatic state persistence, no workflow disruption |
| Team Leads | Progress tracking | High | Accurate timestamps, completion status |
| DevOps | System reliability | Medium | Error handling, logging |
| Project Managers | Reporting | Medium | Audit trail, metrics |

### Why Now?
As teams scale their use of The Startup CLI, the lack of persistent todo states creates collaboration friction and reduces trust in automated implementation tracking.

### Success Looks Like
- [x] Todo state changes persist to PLAN.md within 500ms
- [x] Zero manual intervention required for status updates
- [x] Complete audit trail with timestamps for all state transitions

**Key Performance Indicators:**
1. State Persistence Rate: 100% of changes saved
2. Update Latency: <500ms per write operation
3. Data Integrity: 0% corruption rate

## Business Objectives
1. **Primary Objective:** Enable real-time todo state synchronization
   - Success Criteria: All state changes persist automatically
   - Business Value: Improved collaboration and progress tracking

2. **Secondary Objectives:**
   - Provide audit trail with completion timestamps
   - Maintain compatibility with version control systems
   - Preserve markdown formatting and structure

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements
| ID    | Requirement                   | Priority              | Acceptance Criteria   |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| FR01  | Detect todo state transitions | Must | All pending→in_progress→completed transitions captured |
| FR02  | Update PLAN.md checkboxes | Must | - [ ] becomes - [x] on completion |
| FR03  | Add completion timestamps | Should | Timestamp comments added without breaking markdown |
| FR04  | Preserve file structure | Must | Indentation, formatting unchanged |
| FR05  | Handle nested todos | Should | Support hierarchical task structures |

### Non-Functional Requirements
| ID    | Requirement                   | Priority              | Acceptance Criteria   |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| NR01  | Write operations <100ms | Must | 95th percentile under threshold |
| NR02  | Atomic updates | Must | No partial writes or corruption |
| NR03  | Cross-platform support | Must | Windows, macOS, Linux compatible |
| NR04  | Graceful error handling | Must | Log warnings, don't fail commands |
| NR05  | Concurrent access safety | Should | Detect and handle file locks |

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions
- PLAN.md files use standard markdown checkbox syntax
- Single CLI process modifies files at a time
- Files are UTF-8 encoded
- Users have write permissions to PLAN.md files

### Dependencies
- File system access and permissions
- TodoWrite tool for in-memory state
- Markdown parsing capabilities
- Operating system file locking mechanisms

## Risks and Mitigation

| ID    | Risk                  | Impact            | Probability       | Mitigation Strategy   |
|-------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| RI01  | File corruption | High | Low | Backup before modification, validate writes |
| RI02  | Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Incremental updates, not full rewrites |
| RI03  | Race conditions | Medium | Low | File locking, optimistic concurrency |
| RI04  | External editor conflicts | Low | Medium | Detect external changes, merge strategies |

## Constraints
- **Budget:** Use existing infrastructure
- **Timeline:** Implementation within current release cycle
- **Resources:** Single developer allocation
- **Regulatory:** N/A
- **Organizational:** Follow existing CLI patterns and conventions
- **Security/Compliance:** No sensitive data in timestamps or logs
