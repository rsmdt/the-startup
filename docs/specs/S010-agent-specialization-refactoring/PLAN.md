## Implementation Strategy

Based on the-chief's complexity assessment (8/10 overall risk), this implementation uses a **phase-gated approach** with mandatory quality gates. The highest risk is in Phase 2 (Content Transformation) which requires careful validation against PRINCIPLES.md design guidelines.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Enable nested agent directory structure and asset discovery

- [x] **Phase 1.1:** Enhanced Asset Discovery [`complexity: medium`] [`risk: moderate`]
  - [x] Enable nested directory support in asset loading system
  - [x] Preserve "the-*" naming convention validation for all agents
  - [x] Ensure embedded filesystem works with domain folder structure
  - [x] **Validate**: `go build -o the-startup && ./the-startup install --dry-run`
  - [x] **Review**: [`review: architecture, performance`]

- [x] **Phase 1.2:** Hook Processing Enhancement [`complexity: medium`] [`risk: moderate`] [`parallel: true`]
  - [x] Update hook processing to support nested agent names (domain/specialization)
  - [x] Ensure JSONL logging format remains compatible
  - [x] Maintain existing Task tool integration patterns
  - [x] **Validate**: `echo '{"tool_name":"Task","tool_input":{"subagent_type":"the-api-design"}}' | ./the-startup log --assistant`
  - [x] **Review**: [`review: integration, performance`]

- [x] **Phase 1.3:** Infrastructure Testing [`complexity: low`] [`risk: minimal`]
  - [x] Create test directory structure with sample nested agents
  - [x] Validate asset discovery finds all agents correctly
  - [x] Test hook processing with nested agent names
  - [x] **Validate**: `go test ./internal/... -v`

**Phase 1 Gate**: Infrastructure ready for agent content transformation

## Phase 2: Content Transformation (5-6 weeks) **CRITICAL PHASE**

**Goal**: Transform ~25 agents into ~60 specialized agents while preserving expertise

### Phase 2.1: Domain Directory Creation [`complexity: low`] [`risk: minimal`]

- [x] Create the 9 domain directory structure [`complexity: low`]
  - [x] `assets/claude/agents/the-analyst/` (5 specializations)
  - [x] `assets/claude/agents/the-architect/` (7 specializations) 
  - [x] `assets/claude/agents/the-software-engineer/` (10 specializations)
  - [x] `assets/claude/agents/the-designer/` (6 specializations)
  - [x] `assets/claude/agents/the-security-engineer/` (5 specializations)
  - [x] `assets/claude/agents/the-platform-engineer/` (11 specializations)

  - [x] **Validate**: `find assets/claude/agents -type d -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 | wc -l` (should be 9)

### Phase 2.2: Core Foundation Domains [`complexity: high`] [`risk: critical`]

**Goal**: Create foundation domains needed by other specializations

#### Agent Content Creation Guidelines

Each specialized agent must follow PRINCIPLES.md requirements:

**Outcome-Driven Personality Formula**: `"You are a pragmatic [specialization] who [specific valuable outcome]."`

**Examples for this phase**:
- API Design: "creates interfaces developers love to use"
- Database Design: "balances data consistency with query performance" 
- Component Architecture: "builds reusable UI patterns that scale across teams"
- System Design: "translates business needs into maintainable architectures"

**Flexible Structure Approach**:
- Expand Focus Areas when specialization genuinely requires more clarity
- Extend Approach section for complex methodologies requiring sequencing
- Elaborate Expected Output when multiple deliverable types or integration points exist
- Structure serves the activity focus, not rigid template compliance

**Framework-Agnostic Activity Focus**:
- Primary expertise in the activity (what they DO)
- Secondary framework adaptation (how patterns apply to detected tech)
- Clear business value connection for each specialization
