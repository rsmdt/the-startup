# Solution Design Document

## Constraints

- **Technical**: Must maintain "the-*" naming convention for all agents; preserve existing Task tool invocation pattern (`Task(subagent_type="name")`); maintain Go embed.FS asset system; ensure seamless transition to new specialized structure
- **Organizational**: Cannot break existing commands (/s:specify, /s:implement, /s:refactor) that depend on current agent names; must preserve existing agent capabilities; minimize disruption to active development workflows
- **Security/Compliance**: Maintain secure file handling patterns; preserve input validation in hook processing; ensure agent isolation principles remain intact
- **Performance**: Maintain current agent loading speed; avoid memory overhead from nested directory scanning; preserve efficient JSONL logging performance

## Implementation Context

*Bridge between current flat agent structure and specialized domain-organized architecture. Current system uses broad role-based agents that must be refactored into specialized activity agents while preserving all functionality.*

- **Can Modify**: Agent file organization and directory structure; agent content structure and specialization; delegation patterns and orchestration logic; installation and discovery processes
- **Must Not Touch**: Core hook processing JSON format; Task tool API; embed.FS compilation patterns; JSONL logging format; existing settings.json integration

## Solution Strategy

- **Architecture Pattern**: Activity-Based Specialization - organize agents by capabilities and activities rather than traditional engineering roles, following proven LLM multi-agent patterns from CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph research
- **Integration Approach**: Consolidate development activities under unified "the-developer" with task-specific specializations, while preserving truly domain-specific agents (mobile, security, UX); maintain existing Task tool patterns with enhanced parallel execution capabilities  
- **Justification**: Research from 2024-2025 consistently shows LLMs perform 2.86%-21.88% better with task-based specialization vs role-based organization. Popular frameworks (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) unanimously use capability-driven agents rather than traditional engineering silos. Modern full-stack development makes backend/frontend boundaries artificial for LLM context.

**Key Design Principles Applied**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent handles exactly one activity/specialization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Analysis → Design → Implementation → Review workflow
- **Activity-Based Organization**: Organized by WHAT agents do, not WHO they represent
- **Framework-Aware Activities**: Agents adapt to detected frameworks while maintaining activity focus
- **Human-Readable Navigation**: Familiar role buckets (developer, architect, designer)
- **Conway's Law**: Structure mirrors effective software team communication patterns
- **Modular Composability**: Agents can be combined for complex workflows

## Runtime View

#### Primary Flow: Specialized Task Orchestration
1. User invokes orchestrator agent (e.g., `the-backend-orchestrator`)
2. Orchestrator analyzes task complexity and required specializations
3. Orchestrator decomposes task into specialized activities
4. System validates parallel execution feasibility and agent availability
5. Multiple specialized agents execute concurrently with isolated contexts
6. Results aggregated and validated by orchestrator
7. Unified response delivered to user

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant BackendOrchestrator as "the-backend-orchestrator"
participant APIDesignAgent as "the-api-design" 
participant DatabaseAgent as "the-database-design"
participant SecurityAgent as "the-security-audit"
participant TaskTool

User -> BackendOrchestrator : Task(subagent_type: "the-backend-orchestrator", prompt: "Build user auth system")
BackendOrchestrator -> BackendOrchestrator : analyzeComplexity()
BackendOrchestrator -> BackendOrchestrator : decomposeIntoSpecializations()

par Parallel Specialization
    BackendOrchestrator -> TaskTool : Task(subagent_type: "the-api-design", context: "Auth API endpoints")
    TaskTool -> APIDesignAgent : Execute with specialized context
    APIDesignAgent --> TaskTool : API specification
    
and
    BackendOrchestrator -> TaskTool : Task(subagent_type: "the-database-design", context: "User auth schema")  
    TaskTool -> DatabaseAgent : Execute with specialized context
    DatabaseAgent --> TaskTool : Database schema
    
and
    BackendOrchestrator -> TaskTool : Task(subagent_type: "the-security-audit", context: "Auth security review")
    TaskTool -> SecurityAgent : Execute with specialized context  
    SecurityAgent --> TaskTool : Security recommendations
end

BackendOrchestrator -> BackendOrchestrator : aggregateResults()
BackendOrchestrator -> BackendOrchestrator : validateIntegration()
BackendOrchestrator --> User : Comprehensive auth system implementation
@enduml
```

### Error Handling
- **Invalid specialization request**: Orchestrator falls back to broad agent or suggests alternative specialization path
- **Specialization conflict**: Detect conflicting requirements between specialized agents, escalate to orchestrator for resolution
- **Parallel execution failure**: Continue with completed agents, retry failed agents sequentially, provide partial results with warnings

### Complex Logic
```
ALGORITHM: Orchestrate Specialized Tasks
INPUT: user_request, complexity_assessment, available_specializations
OUTPUT: coordinated_specialized_results

1. ANALYZE_COMPLEXITY: 
   - Extract domain requirements (backend, frontend, platform)
   - Identify specialization needs (API, database, security, UI, etc.)
   - Assess parallel execution feasibility

2. DECOMPOSE_TASK:
   - Map requirements to specialized agent capabilities
   - Create isolated contexts for each specialization  
   - Define success criteria and integration points
   - Identify dependency relationships

3. EXECUTE_SPECIALIZATIONS:
   - Launch parallel specialized agents via Task tool
   - Monitor progress and intermediate results
   - Handle conflicts and dependency violations
   - Validate isolated execution boundaries

4. INTEGRATE_RESULTS:
   - Aggregate specialized outputs
   - Validate cross-specialization consistency
   - Resolve conflicts and gaps
   - Generate comprehensive solution

5. RESPOND:
   - Provide unified implementation
   - Include specialization breakdown
   - Highlight parallel execution efficiency
   - Document decision rationale
```

## Deployment View

- **Environment**: Compiled Go binary with embedded agents via embed.FS; supports existing installation paths (~/.claude, .the-startup)
- **Configuration**: Maintains existing settings.json integration; preserves hook configuration; supports nested agent directory discovery
- **Dependencies**: No new external dependencies; leverages existing Task tool and hook processing system; compatible with current Claude Code integration
- **Performance**: Improved parallel execution capability; maintains current agent loading speed; enhanced task decomposition and specialization efficiency

### Implementation Patterns

#### Specialization Agent Pattern
```pseudocode
# Template for creating specialized agents
AGENT: the-{specialization}
  METADATA:
    domain: {backend|frontend|platform|quality|product|specialized}
    orchestrator: the-{domain}-orchestrator
    parallel_capable: true|false
    expertise: [specific_areas]
    
  INITIALIZATION:
    specialization_context: domain_specific_knowledge
    focus_boundaries: what_this_agent_handles
    exclusion_boundaries: what_this_agent_ignores
    
  EXECUTION:
    VALIDATE: request_within_specialization  
    FOCUS: specialized_task_execution
    OUTPUT: domain_specific_results
    INTEGRATE: orchestrator_compatible_format
```

#### Orchestrator Delegation Pattern
```pseudocode  
# How orchestrators coordinate specialized agents
FUNCTION: orchestrate_specialized_execution(complex_task)
  ANALYZE: task_complexity, required_specializations
  DECOMPOSE: 
    FOR each_specialization_needed:
      CREATE: isolated_context(requirements, boundaries)
      PREPARE: specialized_task(context, success_criteria)
      
  EXECUTE:
    PARALLEL_LAUNCH: all_independent_specializations
    MONITOR: progress, conflicts, dependencies
    COORDINATE: inter_agent_communication_if_needed
    
  INTEGRATE:
    AGGREGATE: all_specialized_results
    VALIDATE: consistency, completeness, quality
    RESOLVE: conflicts_and_gaps
    RESPOND: unified_comprehensive_solution
```

#### Framework Detection Pattern
```pseudocode
# How agents detect and adapt to project frameworks
FUNCTION: detect_and_adapt_framework(project_context, activity)
  ANALYZE: project_files, dependencies, configuration
  IDENTIFY: primary_frameworks, secondary_tools, patterns
  ADAPT: activity_patterns_to_detected_frameworks
  APPLY: framework_specific_best_practices
  RETURN: adapted_recommendations_with_framework_context
```

#### Error Recovery Pattern
```pseudocode
# Handling specialization failures gracefully  
FUNCTION: handle_specialization_errors(failed_agents, partial_results)
  CLASSIFY: 
    critical_failures: specializations_required_for_success
    optional_failures: nice_to_have_specializations
    
  RECOVER:
    RETRY: critical_failures_with_fallback_context
    CONTINUE: with_available_results_from_successful_agents
    FALLBACK: to_broad_agent_if_multiple_critical_failures
    
  RESPOND:
    success_results: from_completed_specializations  
    warnings: about_failed_specializations
    suggestions: for_retry_or_alternative_approaches
```

### Integration Points

- **Task Tool Integration**: Specialized agents invoked through Task(subagent_type="the-*") pattern; orchestrators coordinate multiple Task invocations; enhanced context passing for specialization
- **Hook Processing**: Enhanced logging captures specialization metadata and orchestration decisions; parallel execution tracking in JSONL logs; agent performance analytics across specializations  
- **Command Integration**: /s:implement uses specialized parallel execution; /s:refactor leverages specialized agents for targeted improvements; /s:specify uses specialized analysis agents

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Activity-Based Agent Organization**: Consolidate development activities under unified "the-developer" with task-specific specializations
   - Rationale: Research shows 2.86%-21.88% performance improvement with task-based vs role-based specialization; popular frameworks (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph) unanimously use capability-driven organization; modern full-stack development makes backend/frontend boundaries artificial
   - Trade-offs: Departure from familiar role-based structure, but significant LLM performance and parallel execution gains

2. **Preserve Domain-Specific Expertise**: Keep truly specialized domains (mobile, security, UX, data, product) as separate agent folders
   - Rationale: These represent genuinely different skill sets and knowledge domains that benefit from specialization; mobile development has platform-specific constraints; security requires specialized threat knowledge; UX needs design thinking expertise
   - Trade-offs: Maintains some complexity but preserves essential domain boundaries where specialization adds real value

3. **Eliminate Artificial Engineering Boundaries**: Remove backend-engineer/frontend-engineer/qa-engineer distinctions in favor of activity-based specialization
   - Rationale: Modern development is increasingly full-stack; API design requires understanding both client and server; LLMs perform better with focused task context rather than arbitrary domain boundaries; research shows 21.88% performance improvement with activity-based vs role-based organization
   - Trade-offs: Breaks from traditional team structures, but aligns with research-proven LLM effectiveness patterns

4. **Preserve "the-*" Naming Convention**: Maintain existing naming pattern for all agents and specializations
   - Rationale: Preserves existing Task tool invocation patterns, maintains user familiarity, ensures consistency
   - Trade-offs: Slightly verbose names, but consistency outweighs brevity

5. **Framework-Aware Activity Specialization**: Agents maintain activity focus while adapting to detected frameworks
   - Rationale: Avoids agent proliferation (no React/Vue/Angular variants needed); maintains focused context for better LLM performance; supports multi-framework projects; preserves single responsibility principle
   - Trade-offs: More sophisticated context detection logic, but prevents exponential growth of framework-specific agents

6. **Enhanced Context Isolation**: Specialized agents receive focused context specific to their activity expertise
   - Rationale: Improves response quality, reduces token usage, enables true parallel execution without conflicts; aligns with sparse expert model trends  
   - Trade-offs: More complex context preparation logic, but better results and performance backed by 2024-2025 research

## Quality Requirements

- **Performance**: Specialized parallel execution reduces task completion time by 60-80% for complex tasks; agent loading time remains under 100ms; orchestration overhead under 50ms per delegation
- **Usability**: Intuitive role-based navigation ensures zero learning curve for existing users; enhanced error messages guide users to appropriate specializations; clear specialization documentation
- **Security**: Isolation boundaries prevent specialized agents from accessing out-of-scope data; orchestrators validate all inter-agent communication; audit trail captures all specialization decisions
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when specializations unavailable; comprehensive error recovery patterns; orchestrators provide partial results when some specializations fail

## Risks and Technical Debt

### Known Technical Issues
- **Asset Discovery Performance**: Nested directory scanning may impact agent loading time if not optimized properly; recursive embed.FS walking could cause memory overhead with deep nesting
- **Context Complexity**: Specialized agents require more sophisticated context preparation; orchestrators must manage multiple contexts simultaneously; potential for context bleeding between parallel agents
- **Delegation Logic Complexity**: Orchestrators contain complex decision trees for specialization selection; inter-agent communication coordination adds complexity; parallel execution synchronization challenges

### Technical Debt  
- **Documentation Requirements**: Each specialized agent requires comprehensive documentation; orchestration patterns need detailed examples; specialization guides necessary for optimal usage
- **Testing Complexity**: Must test both individual specializations and orchestrated combinations; parallel execution introduces race condition testing needs; comprehensive agent interaction testing required

### Implementation Gotchas
- **embed.FS Path Handling**: Nested directories require careful path resolution; must preserve asset embedding performance; Windows path separator handling in nested structure
- **Agent Context Isolation**: Preventing context leakage between parallel specialized agents; ensuring task boundaries don't overlap; managing shared resources across specializations  
- **Hook Processing Compatibility**: Enhanced agent ID extraction must handle nested paths correctly; JSONL logging format must accommodate specialization metadata; performance impact of enhanced processing
- **Orchestration Decision Logic**: Complex algorithms for task decomposition into specializations; dependency detection between specialized tasks; conflict resolution when specializations overlap

## Test Specifications

### Critical Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Specialized Parallel Execution**
```gherkin
Given: User requests complex backend task requiring multiple specializations
And: the-backend-orchestrator, the-api-design, the-database-design, the-security-audit agents are available
When: User invokes Task(subagent_type: "the-backend-orchestrator", prompt: "Build complete user authentication system")
Then: Orchestrator decomposes task into parallel specializations
And: Multiple specialized agents execute concurrently
And: Results are integrated into comprehensive solution
And: Response time is 60-80% faster than single-agent approach
```

**Scenario 2: Backward Compatibility**  
```gherkin
Given: Legacy code using Task(subagent_type: "the-backend-engineer")
And: New specialized agent structure is deployed
When: Legacy agent is invoked with existing syntax
Then: Request is automatically delegated to the-backend-orchestrator
And: Enhanced specialized results are returned
And: Migration notice is included in response
And: No breaking changes occur in calling code
```

**Scenario 3: Specialization Failure Recovery**
```gherkin  
Given: Orchestrator planning parallel specialization execution
And: One specialized agent (the-security-audit) fails during execution
When: Other specialized agents (the-api-design, the-database-design) complete successfully
Then: Orchestrator continues with successful results
And: Appropriate warnings about failed specialization are provided
And: User is offered options to retry failed specialization or continue
And: Partial results maintain quality and completeness
```

**Scenario 4: Asset Discovery in Nested Structure**
```gherkin
Given: Agents organized in nested domain directories
And: Asset loading system scanning embedded filesystem
When: System discovers and loads all specialized agents
Then: All agents in nested directories are found and loaded correctly
And: Agent loading performance remains under 100ms
And: "the-*" naming convention is preserved across all domains
And: No agents are missed or duplicated in discovery process
```
