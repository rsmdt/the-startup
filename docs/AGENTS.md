## Agent Delegation Patterns

### Parallel Execution

Most tasks benefit from parallel agent execution. The system automatically identifies independent activities and launches appropriate specialists simultaneously.

```
Example: "Add user authentication"
‚Üí Parallel execution:
   - database-design: User schema
   - api-design: Auth endpoints
   - component-architecture: Login UI
   - authentication-systems: OAuth flow
```

### Sequential Dependencies

When tasks have dependencies, agents execute in proper sequence with context passing.

```
Example: "Migrate database schema"
‚Üí Sequential execution:
   1. database-design: New schema
   2. data-modeling: Migration plan
   3. test-implementation: Migration tests
   4. deployment-strategies: Rollout plan
```

### Specialist Selection

The system selects agents based on activity matching, not role assumptions:

- ‚úÖ "Build API endpoints" ‚Üí `api-design` + `api-documentation`
- ‚úÖ "Optimize queries" ‚Üí `query-optimization` + `system-performance`
- ‚ùå "Backend work" ‚Üí Too vague, needs activity specification

## Using Agents Effectively

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific about activities**: "Implement caching" is better than "improve performance"
2. **Let the system parallelize**: Don't manually sequence unless dependencies exist
3. **Trust specialist selection**: The system matches activities to appropriate agents
4. **Review agent outputs**: Agents provide recommendations, you make decisions

### Common Patterns

#### Feature Development
```
requirements-clarification ‚Üí system-design ‚Üí parallel(api-design, component-architecture, database-design) ‚Üí test-implementation
```

#### Performance Optimization
```
system-performance ‚Üí parallel(query-optimization, performance-optimization) ‚Üí performance-testing ‚Üí deployment-strategies
```

#### Security Hardening
```
vulnerability-assessment ‚Üí parallel(authentication-systems, data-protection) ‚Üí security-incident-response planning
```

#### Refactoring
```
code-review ‚Üí architecture-review ‚Üí parallel(targeted refactoring by specialists) ‚Üí test-implementation
```

## Agent Evolution

Agents continuously improve through:

- **Community feedback**: Real usage shapes agent behavior
- **Pattern recognition**: Common workflows become optimized
- **Capability expansion**: New activities added based on needs
- **Performance tuning**: Response quality and speed improvements
